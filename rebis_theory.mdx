  _"A Monstrous Research"_

</SubTitleCentered>

This project is meant to overanalyze Spiral Knights' themes, worldbuilding, and lore with a primary goal of offering a narratively satisfying, cohesive and conclusive interpretation of the timeline, while achieving closure for each of its subplots.

## Method

It is important to note that at no point the resulting timeline is considered a single true representation of events, but rather, it is an exploration and an analysis of a series of educated guesses, which we propose to possess an overarching narrative.

In order to achieve said cohesiveness, we will follow 3 rules, which will outline our scope of work:

1. The __official game__ and its _adjacent contents_ are used in the construction of the timeline.

    These include DLCs, annual events with corresponding announcements on the [forums](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/forum/8), as those are framed in a diegetic form, as _memorandums_, and entries on the [wiki](https://wiki.spiralknights.com), specifically those which are authored by the [official team](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Credits).

    From the forums we will also include [Clockworks Confidentials](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Credits#Clockworks_Confidential) and other commentaries of the official team into the scope of our analysis.

2. Everything of __official reasources is considered canon__, from recipes' contents and descriptions, to enemies' names and classifications. __Rank missions and Arcade define canon__, where the _Arcade is considered a tool of environmental storytelling_, and one preceding rank missions, while serving them as a thematic foundation.

    We will also work from assumption, that crafting, alchemy, or transmutation of the equipment is generally done with the intended materials from an in-universe perspective.

    For example, in order to transmute a 5-star [Combuster](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Combuster), [ironwood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironwood) is used - we assume it being used within the setting, when the materials are deposited into an [alchemy machine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alchemy_Machine).

    The cases, where a description conflicts with the contents of the recipe, are to be explored in greater detail, until a plausible explanation can be presented, _reducing cases of retcon_, while operating within general themes of set context and an in-universe explanation. This approach also will be also applied to rank missions, enemies, and the rest of the content, wherein conflicting information is identified.

    We will rely on the official wiki for most of discussed descriptions of items, regions, etc., but as some [content is absent or not documented on the wiki](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/SpiralKnights:General_disclaimer), we will present the precise source and location for those materials as we reference them or their descriptions.

    In some instances, the wiki contains materials, [exclusive](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall) _for it as a storytelling medium and source of truth_, which clarify aspects of the setting. We will note those instances, as we cover them in the context of a discussed topic, considering them canon.

3. We assume _consistency of themes_ and _confidence of a narrative_. That is the sum of prior points, which assumes, that the story is complete, despite its elemnts being presented in a nonchronologic manner. We rely on the assumption, that the stories and involved in them characters possess conclusive ends, as far as an MMO by its nature would allow.

As for the inspirations, relations to folklore, mythology, and other franchises, - they will be brought up wherein we believe they present a case of plausible inspiration for identified narratives, as those usually make up the foundation of the final work.

The justification or placement of any event or characters' decisions will be discussed from the in-universe perspective, acknowledging, but excluding [out-of-universe](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist) explanation. And, as the prior can contain design flaws, causal inconsistencies, or oversights, those are required to be identified and explored, before relying on the latter explanation.

With consideration of Spiral Knights as a product of its time, with present vagueness of the story, ambiguities, and unanswered questions, paired with setting's identified throughout the following discussion themes, we will explore boundaries for a generally accepted degree of plausibility and thought put into the timeline and the theory.

We acknowledge those boundaries as we discuss more trivial, implied, and potentially speculated interpretations regarding the story and its details in order to derive most complete explanation, closure, and conclusiveness of any loose ends of the story. Due to this intention, some meanings and interpretations will be presented, that were potentially never been implied by original authors and are solely our mistaken conclusions.

More so, based on those requirements, we consider this work also an exploration of the setting as it is presented, in order to _test limits of how its conflicting elements fit together under a unified explanation_, if such could be derived.

With this foundation for a thought framework, we will go through the entirety of the story and lore of Spiral Knights, _backed by the analysis of every dialogue, item description, design, symbolism, and connections_, perceived as relevant to a current topic. Authors of this document acknowledge, that there are undiscovered fictional inspirations and themes, which they may not be unaware of.

Through the course of this analysis we will propose _a definitive timeline_, and a principles behind it, which interpret, explain, and identify Spiral Knights' cosmology, as one _revolving around the alchemical interpretation of reality_, here labeled as the Rebis theory. The previously mentioned framework will make up a significant part of the Rebis theory, while the latter, despite its name, is meant to emphasized that exact alchemical narrative.

The timeline consists of several chapters, throughout which we cover individual civilizations found on Cradle.

  - [Chapter 1](#chapter-i-cosmology) establishes _basic outline of the Spiral Knights' fictional Universe_, its cosmology, creation myth, and first alchemical narratives.
  - [Chapter 2](#chapter-ii-establishment-of-undercorp) introduces _major actors within Underworld_.
  - [Chapter 3](#chapter-iii-ancient-titans) covers _creators of tortodrones_ found in [March of the Tortodrones](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones).
  - [Chapter 4](#chapter-iv-valkyries-of-heavenly-kingdom) makes introduction of the _heavenly kingdom and valkyries_.
  - [Chapter 5]() introduces _Spiral Order and Isorans_ into the story, while covering their civilization prior to arrival on Cradle.
  - [Chapter 6](#chapter-vi-arrival-of-undercorp) covers effects of _Underworld's influence onto Cradle_ in the context of a previously covered [civilization behind tortodrones](#chapter-iii-ancient-titans).
  - [Chapter 7](#chapter-vii-kingdom-of-almire) covers a period of time embodied by the _kingdom of Almire_.
  - [Intermission 1](#intermission-gunslinger-priests-of-the-forgotten-time) covers a period of time, labeled the "forgotten time".
  - [Chapter 8](#chapter-viii-kat-tribe) cover _Owlites and the Kat Tribe_, their relation and history, connecting them to valkyries of [chapter 4](#chapter-iv-valkyries-of-heavenly-kingdom).
  - [Intermission 2](#intermission-analysis-of-curse) makes the final analysis of the [Curse](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Curse), its effects, metaphysical laws, themes, and inspirations, focusing on its relevance in the story beyond gameplay mechanics.
  - [Chapter 9](#chapter-ix-gremlin-empire) covers _gremlins and Clockworks_, _presence of slime family of monsters_, and the entirety of _Core and Swarm relation_ backed by all of previously found motifs and themes.
  - [Chapter 10](#chapter-x-spiral-knights) is the __final summarization of the timeline__.

### _Chapter `I`_ Cosmology

At first, we will establish rough outline of the cosmology based on rank missions' briefings, dialogue, item, and equipment descriptions. We are not currently concerned with exact in-universe laws, under which each location operates, but with their themes.

While we believe both in-Universe physical laws and symbolic themes are important for the color-coded setting, with no knowledge of the prior, we can rely only on discovered patterns within the stories, and from them assume existence of those laws.

Then, we will attempt to find symbolic element to them and cross-reference with mythology and folklore, as stories found there across multitude of cultures will serve us _as scaffolding and approximate guidelines for our theory on what we judge to be thematically fitting from a storytelling perspective_ while pointing out similarities, which could or could not be a source of inspiration.

As for the themes emerging here from the relations between its' elements, they, we believe, as parts of the story, should also be internally consistent.

Those steps, we believe, would allow us to reverse engineer and understand an internally consistent physical foundation for the story to unfold.

#### Material Realm

As it is the main location of the setting, we need to label it and distinguish it from other dimensions, locations, or realms. The name we propose and which we will use throughout the document is found in the contrast to a different realm, taken from the description of [Weight of Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness): `Why spirits return to the material realm is unknown`, - the material realm.

#### Underworld

Underworld, as it is referred as such in the mission [Weight of Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness): `It is speculated that all fiends within the Clockworks crossed over from a dimension known as the Underworld`, is the homeworld for the most of fiendish wildlife, such as [greavers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greaver) and [gorgos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgo). Fiendish nature and ecosystem are isolated to the Underworld and effects of its presence on material realm will be closely observed throughout the timeline.

Underworld is also the homeworld for [devilites](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Devilite), who are considered the workforce of the Underworld, as specified by the information module of [Devilish Drudgery](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Devilish_Drudgery): `The office minions of the Underworld are a disgruntled lot, attacking any unauthorized personnel on sight. While not terrible threats on their own, they can become far worse if one of their Pit Bosses gets a hold of them`. Based on mission's name and description of [White Collar Captives](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/White_collar_captives) devilites are considered by the Spiral Order as the office workers, - "white collars". That it is, if missions' descriptions are diegetic, written by Spiral Order, which we assume to be true.

Here we also acquire one of clues on the relation between Spiral Order and devilites:

- `A fiendish city is a strange place that Spiral HQ still does not fully understand.` ([White Collar Captives](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/White_collar_captives)).
- `It is speculated that all fiends within the Clockworks crossed over from a dimension known as the Underworld` ([Weight of Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness)).

Those instances of referring to Underworld and devilites, we may suggest, frame Spiral Order as ones who did not have an earlier opportunity to study devilites prior to Skylark crash landing on Cradle, meaning that Underworld had remained undiscovered by the Spiral Order. It could also be a case of Spiral Order being vaguely aware of the Underworld, but the significant progress in its understanding was made only on Cradle.

#### Apocrean Realm

Apocrean Realm has a relation to the Underworld through the presence of shadow damage, Undead, and presence of Lost Souls, as seen by the events of the [Shroud of Apocrea](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea), specifically, the [Grasping Plateau](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Grasping_Plateau), as it contains [Freed Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Freed_Soul), Undead, and devilites. The [Obsidian Nexus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Obsidian_Nexus) in that regard has direct presence of [Lost Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul).

Shadow damage is described by [Hahn, Spiral Order biotech](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hahn) as follows: `Shadow damage is generally caused by concentrations of negative energy. Attacks that inflict shadow damage include anything from the psychic manipulation of the aforementioned negative energy to physical attacks using weapons forged from dark matter` ([The Shadow Knows - Hahn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hahn#Dialogue)).

A more vague connection, which will be an ongoing theme, is the usage of the same words or patterns to characterize related items. For example, [Obsidian Shard](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Shard) is described to be `jet-black`, same as [Trojan Horseshoe](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Trojan_Horseshoe). Trojans are said to belong to the legion of Ur, which is sealed within the Underworld (`the memo indicated that the Legion of Ur was sealed away in the Underworld` - [Legion of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur)). Weather trojans are native to the Underworld will be explored in the [Legion of Ur section](#legion-of-ur).

##### Introduction of Souls

Here we should focus on Souls, as they are present across many separated location of Cradle, including Apocrean realm, Graveyards, and the Core:

- `The intel we've collected so far suggests that fiends utilize large deposits of the stuff to trap the souls of the lost within it, like some kind of icy prison. It would seem that Maulos, that horrible arch-fiend you just took down, had a different use in mind and was actually destroying this everfrost to unleash ... souls into the Clockworks` ([Heart of Ice - Everfrost Tower - Recon Ranger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Everfrost_Tower)).
- `A 'towering pillar' of everfrost and 'all the frozen souls it brings forth'` - [Heart of Ice - Amu-Sol - Fiendish Memo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Amu-Sol)
- `Only souls keep these engines roaring, heard screaming across distant stars. Only souls can fill their void, sublime in its vast emptiness` ([The Shroud of Apocrea - Patch Notes: 2013.10.23](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)).

Souls, ones that were suggested to be trapped in everfrost, which makes up Everfrost Pillar delivered from Underworld, we believe to be the same as the Lost Souls, or rather, [Frost Soul](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Frozen_Soul) variation encountered during the events of the [Heart of Ice mission](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice). Those souls may potentially be ones referred to as spirits, with the general inclusion of the undead: `Why spirits return to the material realm is unknown` ([Weight of Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness)).

All of those descriptions as well as presence of lost souls in the [Obsidian Nexus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Obsidian_Nexus) suggests that Apocrean Realm and Underworld are connected, although nature of that connection is unknown at that point in the analysis.

#### Blinding Abyss

Blinding Abyss is one of a few realms described the least. It is a location closely related to frost. its name is taken from [Fiendish Memo of Amu-Sol](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Amu-Sol) - (`Blinding Abyss` - [Fiendish Memo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Amu-Sol)). Despite being present only within a context of [Heart of Ice](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Amu-Sol), it has multiple Underworld entities tied with it, namely devilites and [Maulos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maulos#Maulos).

Judging by same reference to Maulos and his implied shadow-damaging powers of the Eternal Frost (`It is our understanding that all Pit Boss duties, administrative and otherwise, have been turned over to a 'Maulos of the Eternal Frost,', is that correct?` - [Heart of Ice - Amu-Sol - Fiendish Memo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Amu-Sol)), while being a trojan, it is plausible for him to be an entity from the Underworld, yet far more powerful, reminiscent of [Lord Vanaduke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lord_Vanaduke), mainly by both of them being fiends and of a unique kind. History behind Maulos will be examined throughout the analysis, as well as in the [analysis of Underworld influences](#influences-of-underworld), but currently, in the context of overall cosmology, it will be enough, as presence and abilities of Maulos relate to freezing theme of the Blinding Abyss.

#### Nameless Realm

Nameless Realm is mentioned in the description of the [Chaos Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_Cloak): `A forbidden mantle said to grant the wearer protection within the nameless realm where all elements are said to converge into one and divide into all` ([Chaos Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_Cloak)).

At that very point the implied duality of the phrase above must be kept in mind, as this is the first instance a theme of alchemy presented within Spiral Knights' cosmology. Precisely, the concept of the Nameless Realm is one reminiscent of alchemical First Matter:

<BookCitation source="Psychology and Alchemy - Carl Jung">
  {#snippet markup()}

  The ‚Äútreasure hard to attain,‚Äù whose presence was suspected in the dark prima materia, is symbolized by the alchemists in various ways. Christopher of Paris, for instance, says that the chaos (as prima materia) is the work of all-wise nature. Our understanding ... , aided by the ‚Äúcelestial and glowing spirit,‚Äù must transform this natural work of art ‚Äîchaos‚Äîinto the celestial nature of the quintessence, and into the life- giving (vegetabilis) essence of heaven. The precious substance is potentially contained in this chaos as a massa confusa of all the elements rolled into one, and man must diligently apply his mind to it so that ‚Äúour heaven‚Äù may come into reality (ad actum).

  ---

  The earth (as prima materia) is not a dead body, but is inhabited by a spirit that is its life and soul. All created things, minerals included, draw their strength from the earth- spirit. This spirit is life, it is nourished by the stars, and it gives nourishment to all the living things ... This invisible spirit is like the reflection in a mirror, intangible, yet it is at the same time the root of all the substances necessary to the alchemical process or arising therefrom (radix nostrorum corporum).

  {/snippet}
</BookCitation>

As we will demonstrate throughout our analysis of the concept of Energy, Crystal and Mist energy included, the principle, properties, application, nature, and motifs of energy are extremely similar to the alchemical definition of First Matter and greater cosmology.

#### Spirit Mother's Realm

Spirit Mother is an unknown deity, representing nature currently in most general, vague terms:

- `I've heard that some kind of force of nature had once tried to right his wrongs but Lord Vanaduke imprisoned it somewhere within his fortress. Finding and freeing it may prove useful` ([Nameless Lost Soul of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire_(nameless))).
- `Does your guild better commune with the Spirit Mother in her faraway realm?` ([Decorate your Guild Hall with the splendors of Almire!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/102786)).
- `... a force of nature summoned to this realm to extinguish the unnatural fire that is consuming it. ... Now none may proceed beyond the court as columns of shadow fire block all exits. Shadow fire can only be extinguished with the water that flows from these spirit wells. The water is the purest found in all of nature, flowing directly from the springs within the realm of the Spirit Mother herself` ([Firestorm Citadel - Nature Sprite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nature_Sprite)).

This is one of more vague realms, as we have means of Spirit Mother's presence, but not the ends. What is her goal in protecting Almire? We will discuss it with the presented background information in the [analysis of Almire and Spirit Mother](#almire-and-spirit-mother).

#### The Void: Part 1

The Void is mentioned only a few times:

- The names of [Swarm-related entities](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Swarm) - when auto-target is enabled they are described as Void enemies, including the [Void Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Void_Soul) during the events of [Dreams and Nightmares](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares).
- By [a speaker in the Echo Stone of Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone#Echo_Stone): `WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER`.
- By professor [Allister Danford in his journal entry](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276): `Only souls keep these engines roaring, heard screaming across distant stars. Only souls can fill their void, sublime in its vast emptiness`.

The void is currently a metaphysical and metaphorical concept with an unknown placement and role in the cosmology. Here we will only acknowledge its existence without any major analysis, apart from several links to the Swarm and greater Swarm-Core-Sleeper relation.

##### Swarm

The Swarm and the Void so far are connected by an ongoing narrative within the Echo Stones:

- `WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER. ... WITHIN THIS DREAM, ITS MANY EYES CANNOT SEE YOU NOR CAN ITS MANY ARMS REACH YOU. ... USE WHAT IS HERE TO PREPARE FOR THE BATTLE TO COME. IT KNOWS OF YOU NOW. IT WILL FIND A WAY OUT AND COME FOR YOU` ([Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_stones#Echo_Stone)).
- `AS I DREAMED, IT CONSUMED. IT DEVOURED THE KNOWLEDGE OF TIME... MEMORIES OF THE DEAD... THE HEARTS OF KINGS AND THE SOULS OF THEIR PEOPLE... GOOD AND EVIL... IT CONSUMED. IT GREW STRONGER, ENDLESSLY MIRRORING ITSELF WITHIN THE SPACE OF MY DREAM. ENDLESSLY MIRRORING... EXPANDING... INFINITE. WHAT IT WAS BEFORE IT IS NO MORE. NEITHER BEAST NOR GOD, IT IS A CREATION UNLIKE ALL. IT IS... THE SWARM` ([Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_stones#Echo_Stone)).

Swarm in a state, in which it is discovered, we believe, could only be understood and categorized through development of _a conceptual framework_. It will be developed throughout the analysis, and embodied in the later definition of the [Rebis theory](#rebis-theory). The Swarm will be explored in detail in the [Gremlin Empire section](#chapter-ix-gremlin-empire) and then, through application of the framework, [Swarm itself will be analyzed](#the-swarm).

But for now, it must be kept in mind, that a currently unknown link exists between the concept of void and Swarm, at least by an identification of its shadowed enemies.

This presumes, that the interface of the game is one upon which we can rely for more information, being diegetic, as it is what Knights of Spiral Order see through the default animation of any opened menu. Knight's auto target of enemies shows their names, monster family and health. As for the monster families - we come from an idea, that that classification is developed by the Spiral Order biotechs, as they, like [Hahn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hahn), analyzed in [monster families and damage types section](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hahn#Dialogue).

The void will remain unclassified in our description of cosmology until further leads could be found.

#### Energy

There exists power, contained within [Sparks of Life](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spark_of_life#Spark_of_Life), capable of reviving recently deceased Knights. Sparks of Life become available on knight's second perishing, and differ from an initial emergency revive by giving temporary increase to Knight's damage output, accompanied by a rumble across Clockworks, as seen by specs of dust falling as the knight revives.

It can be argued that emergency revive, at its base, is not the Spark of Life itself, but a related mechanism, as one provided by the equipment and capable of being recharged when passing through the depths. As stated, `All knights now have an Emergency Revive mechanism built into their armor that will revive them shortly after falling in combat once per floor. An ER only restores all the red health pips you have, but no more` ([Release Notes: 2013.07.30](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2013-07-30)), `Energy is a very special power that is constantly emanating from the core of this world. It is totally stable and will never be lost unless traded or spent. (You can see how much energy you have on the energy module in your arsenal)` ([Energetic Knight](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Energetic_Knight_Dialogue/Town_Square)).

It must be kept in mind that emergency revive mechanic and Sparks of Life were introduced later in tandem with unification of mist and crystal energy (`Mist energy and mist tank items have been removed. Player-owned mist tanks have been replaced with 10 Sparks of Life (bound). Player-owned mini mist tanks have been replaced with 1 Spark of Life (bound) ‚ÄòCrystal Energy‚Äô is now simply called ‚ÄòEnergy‚Äô. Mist Wells have been renamed 'Energy Wells' and no longer provide a 25% bonus on deposit. Mist within Mist Wells has been converted to energy and may be withdrawn at 100 energy per day` - [Release Notes: 2013.07.30](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2013-07-30)). _While we acknowledge existence of both Crystal and Mist energy, we will follow along the paradigm of a modern unified type of energy_, and reintroducing the prior, wherein we believe it ties to the canon events.

Spark of Life represent a type of energy, which is characterized by the light-blue rectangular pattern and will be referred as such in the analysis. That same energy is observed at Clockworks elevators on their usage. This behavior is also left from the earlier period of energy mechanics, when elevators had required energy to operate and transition depths, but the fact itself of energy used to power them - visually, - remains, and will be kept in mind as an important component to how Clockworks operate as an artificial construct. (`Elevators no longer require any energy to operate. Explore the Clockworks as much and as often as you wish!` - [Release Notes: 2013.07.30](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2013-07-30)).

Apart from this, there are other manifestation of energy, which affect living and non-living matter:

- Minerals are capable of internal depletion (`No more depleted Crimsonite here` - [Deadly Shard Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadly_Shard_Bomb)).
- There are [fuming trojans of tier 3](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Trojan) and [Arkus's burning shard after the first revive](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arkus). Those are supposedly dark matter crystal, which burn with pink flames. They will be later explored in greatest detail in [Legion of Ur section](#legion-of-ur). Those minerals were connected to the activity of Clockworks, notably, [gate construction](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gate_construction), which is later explored in the [tortodrones section](#anatomy-of-tortodrone-and-crimsonite) and [Minerals and Souls relation section](#minerals-and-souls-part-1).
- Existence of [the Artifact](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Artifact), which is connected to the Core through the Consoles. The Artifact is capable of powering Spiral Order field facilities, as seen during the events of [The Ancient Generator](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Ancient_Generator): `If you can restore power to the camp, the Spiral Knights can power their turrets and create a defensive perimeter. Once secure, it may be possible to reconnect with Spiral HQ`.

  By extension, if Artifact's energy is compatible enough with Spiral Order technology, and we can assume that the Core's energy is also compatible, as it is desired by the Spiral Order. The latter, in fact, is the main premise and goal of Spiral Knights for descending into Clockworks: `The Core of the Clockworks could very well contain the energy source we need to create a new power source for the Skylark and restore it to operational condition` ([Reporting for Duty - Feron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Reporting_for_Duty#Dialogue)). The Artifact is also known to be charged by gremlin technology. We will not go into greater details, as we outline main principles, even potentially conflicting ones:

  - `Work away from the others. The Order must never know we have the artifact. Find a way to power it. Bring it to me. Do not betray me. I will know` ([Crossing the Chasm - The Journey to Haven - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crossing_the_Chasm/The_Journey_to_Haven)). We should note, based on general motivation of Herex, his name, and lack of any other candidates, all information modules signed as "-H" are written by Herex. The energy facility of [Restoring the Power](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Ancient_Generator/Restoring_Power) has all the same gremlin technology, the wires that lead up the platform with [the generator/Artifact](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Artifact).
  - `I have already collected the power I need to use the Artifact and nothing you can do now will stop what I have set in motion` ([Shadowplay - throne Room - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Throne_Room)),

- Tearium, the fuel of the main Skylark generator, or likely, reactor, is measured in tons: `After the Skylark crashed, its primary tearium core exploded, destroying a portion of the ship and leaving it without a main power source. Since so far we haven't found several hundred tons of tearium just lying around, the bird has effectively lost its wings` ([Reporting for Duty - Feron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Reporting_for_Duty#Dialogue)). As Skylark secondary generator is barely enough to power the Lab - `We managed to pull the secondary generator from the Skylark mostly intact. Unfortunately its barely powerful enough to keep this lab running, let alone power our ship. We'll need to find another power source if we ever hope to return home` ([Haven - Lab - Biotech]()), - we can establish a vague understanding of technological level of Spiral Order.
- Found across Clockworks, [Fire Crystals](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fire_crystal#Fire_Crystal), and specifically, radiant fire crystals do contain a form of energy and heat. (`The heat within is wild and mysterious, shining brighter than any natural fire` - [Radiant Fire Crystal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fire_crystal#Radiant_Fire_Crystal)).

Then there is the phenomenon of transformed battle sprites seen during the rescue missions of [A Revelation in Flames](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Revelation_in_Flames), [Angels from Antiquity](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angels_from_Antiquity), and [The Phantom Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Phantom_Mask), involving [Drakon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon), [Seraphynx](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphynx), and [Maskeraith](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith) battle sprites. This is not a regular behavior within known by the Spiral Order physics, as suggested by Rhedon: `The energy signature I'm detecting is erratic, but still definitely a battle sprite. They may be in trouble, so let's hurry! ... Something has happened to them, they've changed into some kind of creature. ... They seem friendly. In fact they seem to behave just like the battle sprites I know` ([Sunset Steppes - Rhedon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Revelation_in_Flames/Sunset_Steppes)). Morlin suggests: `Though their cellular identity is still wholly that of a battle sprite. My hypothesis is that somehow they rapidly evolved to survive in their new environment` ([A Revelation in Flames/The Lab - Morlin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Revelation_in_Flames/The_Lab)).

As a speculation, but one to be developed over the analysis, is the mention of `erratic` energy signatures - it  resembles the description of energy of the Core, namely: `we discovered that within the heart of this rock resonates a power signature of unprecedented magnitude` ([Reporting for Duty - Feron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Reporting_for_Duty#Dialogue)), as there is currently no other source of such transformation taking place across Clockworks.

Weather those mentioned earlier categories of energy could be traced back to a universal medium, one potentially represented by the designs of the Whitespace within the Core, remains a open question.

##### Spiral Order, Energy, and introduction to Alchemy

Based on [Kora's dialogue](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Welcome_to_Haven!#Dialogue): `Lastly I need to get you up to speed on something called 'energy.' its very important to your mission here on Cradle`, it can be argued that the concept of energy might be unique to Cradle, but based on presence of energy symbol across Spiral Order equipment, such as turrets and handguns, it might be rather that the low ranking members of Spiral Order simply don't have access or the information about the energy. That could be a plausible solution, considering Spiral Order is a military organization, and, by extensions, Isorans, as they are in a state of existential war with Morai. And then they managed to exist for a long period of time, as evident by the celestial costume set: `This suit was once worn by Isoran starfarers of eons long passed that stood watch over extrasolar operations` ([Stellar Sentinel Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stellar_Sentinel_Suit)).

This idea of granted access to an information based on rank is seen in the application of first special damage type: `It seems the closer monsters get to the Core, the more their unique properties begin to surface. In most cases this takes the form of their being able to inflict special damage types that require special defenses in order to withstand properly. In Tier 2, a monster inflicting a special damage type will always produce a split normal/special damage output. Thus, normal defense is still a somewhat valid defense choice` ([Pierce of Cake - Hahn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pierce_of_Cake)).

Noting here, Energy is also seemingly utilized by knights in 2 more areas:

- Powering dormant constructs and turrets through transfer of energy.
- Skylark's secondary reactor, one located in the Haven's Lab has same light-blue glow to it. Construction of the reactor and the Arcade gate pillars is practically the same, although this could be a case of asset optimization taken game's scope. For now, we consider the latter being th explanation.

The symbol of energy used by the Spiral Order has 2 elements to it, in detail observed in 3 instances:

- [Energy well](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Energy_Well) in Guild Hall has all attributes of energy, the glow, the patterns, and the symbol. What is important is the state of a well, when it contains no energy: the symbol of energy is rotated so that its middle horizontal line becomes vertical, and the symbol itself changes color to darker red.
- The knight's energy counter, when it reaches 0, becomes dark red.
- The [auto turrets](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mecha_Turret#Auto_Turret) of Spiral Order, when they are deactivated, have the same, rotated vertically and red energy symbol.

We will refer to this variation of energy symbol as inverted for the consistency of our terminology.

Here, we would prose a potential link of energy - as a universal or close to one, medium, - and Spiral Order to alchemy, based on the [Alchemy for Beginners](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alchemy_for_Beginners) mission description and dialogue: `Alchemy is a craft mastered by the Spiral Knights that allows for the inherent powers of various materials to awaken and fuse with each other in order to form powerful, new items! The Spiral Order has relied on alchemy as their primary means of creating the very arsenals that Knights have relied upon for centuries. ... That's because every time you transmute an item through alchemy, there is a chance you can get one of several Unique Variants that makes your item much more powerful!` ([Alchemy for Beginners - Bosco](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alchemy_for_Beginners#Dialogue)).

We will consider this in-universe concept of alchemy as one inspired by the real-world many western and eastern interpretations of alchemy, while preserving the core concepts and modernized in the sci-fi setting. The existence of many conflicting interpretations of alchemy is its known property, attributed to its early origin.

<BookCitation source="Psychology and Alchemy - Carl Jung">
  {#snippet markup()}

  Alchemy, as is well known, describes a process of chemical transformation and gives numberless directions for its accomplishment. Although hardly two authors are of the same opinion regarding the exact course of the process and the sequence of its stages, the majority are agreed on the principal points at issue, and have been so from the earliest times, i.e., since the beginning of the Christian era.

  The alchemical opus deals in the main not just with chemical experiments as such, but with something resembling psychic processes expressed in pseudochemical language. The ancients knew more or less what chemical processes were; therefore they must have known that the thing they practised was, to say the least of it, no ordinary chemistry.

  If the alchemist is admittedly using the chemical process only symbolically, then why does he work in a laboratory with crucibles and alembics? And if, as he constantly asserts, he is describing chemical processes, why distort them past recognition with his mythological symbolisms?

  This puzzle has proved something of a headache to many an honest and well-meaning student of alchemy. On the one hand the alchemist declares that he is concealing the truth intentionally, so as to prevent wicked or stupid people from gaining possession of the gold and thus precipitating a catastrophe. But, on the other hand, the same author will assure us that the gold he is seeking is not‚Äîas the stupid suppose‚Äîthe ordinary gold (aurum vulgi), it is the philosophical gold or even the marvellous stone, the lapis invisibilitatis (the stone of invisibility), or the lapis aethereus (the ethereal stone), or finally the unimaginable hermaphroditic rebis, and he will end up by saying that all recipes whatsoever are to be despised.

  ---

  For psychological reasons, however, it is highly unlikely that the motive prompting the alchemist to secrecy and mystification was consideration for mankind. Whenever anything real is discovered it is usually announced with a flourish of trumpets. The fact is that the alchemists had little or nothing to divulge in the way of chemistry, least of all the secret of goldmaking.

  ---

  The real nature of matter was unknown to the alchemist: he knew it only in hints. In seeking to explore it he projected the unconscious into the darkness of matter in order to illuminate it. In order to explain the mystery of matter he projected yet another mystery‚Äî his own unknown psychic background‚Äîinto what was to be explained: Obscurum per obscurius, ignotum per ignotius! This procedure was not, of course, intentional; it was an involuntary occurrence.

</BookCitation>

This introduces a notion of Spiral Order alchemy being a studied and predictable phenomenon, a complete inverse of its real-world counterpart. With this, considering that, initially, transmutation of gear had required energy, and then Orbs of Alchemy, we can make a guess that, as Spiral Order was familiar to alchemy, so energy was not a foreign concept to them.

#### Whitespace

Meanwhile, as its is implied that the Core itself is the energy source, a guess could be made, that it is the space within the Core, either Whitespace itself or some other location hidden within the Core is the real source of energy, from which energy is supplied and then distributed across Clockworks through the boundary of the Core. Here we will not discuss the Sleeper yet.

The fact that the knights contribute energy to an elevator in its required amount, while Spiral Order is not native to Cradle, makes energy seem as more of a cosmological constant. It means that Spiral Order and gremlin technology, such as [mecha knights](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mecha_Knight#Mecha_Knight_Kit) and in lesser manner elevators, would not operate on the same if not more advanced resource belonging to Spiral Order as well as allow for knights to power dormant constructs around Clockworks. This creates a precedent, that energy is neither strictly gremlin nor Spiral Order civilizations' invention, but a universal property, to which both parties can tap into though their respective technology. And if it is a universal property, Whitespace could also be of similar nature, if not its more unknown form, given that it is within the Core to be held, or protected or contained in, in a similar manner to [Energy Wells](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Energy_Well).

Despite earlier separation on Crystal and Mist Energy, and later emergence of unified measure of Energy in-game, it currently is unimportant to overall cosmology, apart from mention of crystals in crystal energy, linked to minerals and older concept of [Gate Construction](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gate_construction) through deposition of Minerals.

Yet, this implication will be kept in mind as part of a worldbuilding framework, under which physical laws of Spiral Knights Universe operate.

Usually Whitespace is discussed in relation to the Swarm, Core and Cradle's past, and here we will do the same - as Swarm requires far greater and deeper analysis outside of current overview of preestablished concepts. Moreover the most of this analysis up to the end of chapter 9 serves as the preparation to this later analysis.

#### Dragons

The [material realm](#material-realm), and possibly, other realms, were inhabited by Dragons:

- The [Riders' Mantles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Rider_Mantle#Frenzy_Rider_Mantle) refer to 3 gods using their elements - storms, rage and frenzy, - to `carve worlds from stone`. That gear is also the first instance of using sigils, which are present on armors' ribbon, they are not seemingly fiendish.
- Multiple [Dragon Helms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Dragon_Helm#Frenzy_Dragon_Helm) refer to beasts, implied to be dragons, based on the equipment name, of storm, rage, and frenzy elements. In passing of those beasts worlds were created, with exception of rage element, which came to be disastrous - `beast who some believe razed the world in its passing: its rage became magma rain, its breath a typhoon` ([Raging Dragon Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raging_Dragon_Helm#Raging_Dragon_Helm)) - a very specific choice to words, compared to other 2 descriptions:

  - `created the world in its passing: its fire the sun, its bones the mountains` ([Storm Dragon Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Dragon_Helm#Storm_Dragon_Helm)).
  - `shaped the world in its passing: its frenzy started the mighty winds, its scales became the shadows` ([Frenzy Dragon Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Dragon_Helm#Frenzy_Dragon_Helm)).

Can it be proven that these were in fact dragons and not a metaphor?

Battle sprite here are the key. We know that Spiral Order knew how dragons look like, based on Rhedon quote: `They seem friendly. In fact they seem to behave just like the battle sprites I know. Only difference is they, uh, well, look like dragons` ([A Revelation in Flames - Sunset Steppes - Rhedon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Revelation_in_Flames/Sunset_Steppes)). Due to an unidentified relation between dragons and Spiral Order, but though the presence of dragon scales in Azure Guardian armor - `A noble helmet reserved for the most senior members of the Spiral Order. The technique which weaves dragon scale seamlessly into the metal is a closely guarded secret` ([Azure Guardian Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Helm)), the naming of Drakon here only affirms Spiral Order's view of them as reminiscent of dragons, which by proxy suggests a general appearance of the latter.

We propose, that 3 sub-specie of Drakons suggest existence of divine, shadow and rage dragons, which, if mapped onto earlier elements of storm, frenzy, and rage would plausibly fit to descriptions of implied dragon beasts, referred in the [Dragon Helms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Dragon_Helm#Frenzy_Dragon_Helm). This logic will be also studied for the existence of Seraphynx battle sprites, as, by a current proposal, they became reincarnations of Kat Tribe. The Kat Tribe will be covered in its own chapter.

We match 3 sub-species of Drakon battle sprites to 3 elements, established earlier. First, there are 3 variant of Drakon: regular [red Drakon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon), [divine Drakon](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon_(Divine)>) and [shadow Drakon](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon_(Shadow)>) suggest existence of divine and shadow aspects to their evolution, if we acknowledge Morlin's explanation: `Though their cellular identity is still wholly that of a battle sprite. My hypothesis is that somehow they rapidly evolved to survive in their new environment` ([A Revelation in Flames/The Lab - Morlin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Revelation_in_Flames/The_Lab)).

While [divine drakon](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon_(Divine)>) can be attributed to an element of storms, and [shadow drakon](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon_(Shadow)>) to frenzy, the regular Drakon relates to rage: `The Drakon is a battle sprite that embodies fiery destruction. Its skills focus on raw, offensive power` ([Drakon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon)), - which could be considered as closely related to a concept of rage. The prior 2 are unlikely to be obtained from the start, so the way Spiral Order refers to Drakon would be characteristic of a connection to rage.

Those naming conventions, their presence, in relation to dragons and drakon sprites we believe to be connected by being different interpretations of fundamental laws of the Universe, with antique convention resenting them as frenzy, rage and divinity, and modern naming convention, one passing through Spiral Order understanding, and characteristic of their properties. This results in a parity of shadow damage/frenzy, normal damage/rage, elemental damage/divinity. Together, they establish concepts of _divinity being same as elemental damage and storms_, the _shadow as frenzy_, and _rage as pure normal damage with a lack of an element, but characteristic ferocity_: `its frenzy started the mighty winds, its scales became the shadows` ([Frenzy Dragon Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Dragon_Helm#Frenzy_Dragon_Helm)).

This description `its frenzy started the mighty winds, its scales became the shadows` ([Frenzy Dragon Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Dragon_Helm#Frenzy_Dragon_Helm)) introduces scales, that are [Dragon Scales](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale), a material, for a fact belonging to a dragon. But now it is question of weather it belongs to shadow sub-specie of dragons, based on the fact it is mentioned for frenzy dragons, or those scales could belong to an entire specie of dragons, as they seemingly surpass elemental classification boundary, not ties to a specific nature.

Those scales could relate to Underworld or to general supernatural by the fact of usage of word `otherworldly`, as may be hinted by the description: `An armored scale from what was thought to be an extinct creature. It reflects light with an otherworldly sheen` ([Dragon Scale](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale)). But, at the same time, items crafted from that material are not restricted to shadow-related damage and defense only, as well as existence of [Divine Drakons](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon_(Divine)>) suggests a nature, thematically different from the Underworld, so the scales could belong to any sub-specie of dragons - which will be our current reasoning, while affirming their extra-natural status without aligning them to a concrete realm.

The rage/normal damage thematic parity is also seen in [tortodrones](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tortodrone): `handgun empowered by the limitless fury of a tortodrone. While wielding it you can feel the berserk energy within eager to be unleashed` ([Grand Tortofist](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Tortofist)), - and it deals pure normal damage. Tortodrones themselves are associated with rage not only by their equipment and design of cosmetics, but the design of an [enraged tortodrone](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones_(Mission)>) of missions card.

While corrupted (`A handgun alchemized from the shell of a corrupted tortodrone.` - [Grim Buster](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Buster)) tortodrones are fought in [Call of the Colossi](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones/Call_of_the_Colossi). The colossi in question, due to tortodrones' size, we suggest, are those exact tortodrones. They still deal normal and elemental damage, despite their corrupted weaponry likely being [Gorgofist](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgofist), as it is a shadow-damaging weapon. So far, we will not delve into the specifics of Tortodrones, as they will be revisited later in the [Arrival of Undercorp section](#chapter-vi-arrival-of-undercorp), where this motif will be explored in greater depth.

As for the divine Drakon and its dragon counterpart, one more similarity can be suggested to parallel to the established idea dragons being interstellar species, but also, as we will se later, tying with the concepts closely related in alchemy:

<BookCitation source="Psychology and Alchemy - Carl Jung">
  {#snippet markup()}

  The dragon in itself is a monstrum - a symbol combining the chthonic principle of the serpent and the aerial principle of the bird. It is, as Ruland says, a variant of Mercurius. But Mercurius is the divine winged Hermes manifest in matter, the god of revelation, lord of thought and sovereign psychopomp. The liquid metal, argentum vivum‚Äî‚Äúliving silver,‚Äù quicksilver‚Äîwas the wonderful substance that perfectly expressed the nature of the œÉœÑŒØŒªŒ≤œâŒΩ: that which glistens and animates within. When the alchemist speaks of Mercurius, on the face of it he means quicksilver, but inwardly he means the world-creating spirit concealed or imprisoned in matter. The dragon is probably the oldest pictorial symbol in alchemy of which we have documentary evidence. It appears as the ŒøœçœÅŒø Œ≤œåœÅŒøœÇ, the tail-eater, in the Codex Marcianus, which dates from the tenth or eleventh century, together with the legend: ŒΩ·ºì œÑ√≤ œÄŒ¨ŒΩ (the One, the All). Time and again the alchemists reiterate that the opus proceeds from the one and leads back to the one, that it is a sort of circle like a dragon biting its own tail. For this reason the opus was often called circulare (circular) or else rota (the wheel). Mercurius stands at the beginning and end of the work: he is the prima materia, the caput corvi, the nigredo; as dragon he devours himself and as dragon he dies, to rise again as the lapis. He is the play of colours in the cauda pavonis and the division into four elements. He is the hermaphrodite that was in the beginning, that splits into the classical brother-sister duality and is reunited in the coniunctio, to appear once again at the end in the radiant form of the lumen novum, the stone. He is metallic yet liquid, matter yet spirit, cold yet fiery, poison and yet healing draught‚Äîa symbol uniting all opposites.

  {/snippet}
</BookCitation>

Due to this we propose that:

- Drakon battle sprites are reincarnations of dragons, both are categorized into sub-species associated with damage types of **storms/divinity/elemental damage**, **rage/normal damage**, and **frenzy/shadow damage**.
- Dragons exist across multiple realms or their habitat is not restricted to a singular celestial body, this feature will be revisited and dissected in relation to Spiral Order in the [Old Order Knights of Isora section](#establishment-of-order) - that Spiral Order is aware of dragons and had their own experiences with them, while it is Cradle of all places which has large amounts of draconic imagery and designs, specifically, across castles and [other set, or strate, of ruins](#veiled-tortodrone-homeland).

#### Creation Myth

At some point in time either Cradle or a planet which was later consumed by the Core as Cradle was built, had formed - it was not of dragons perishing, as described in [Dragon Helms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Dragon_Helm#Frenzy_Dragon_Helm), but rather the planet was inhabited by these dragons, whose power was so immense that it could reshape landscapes. Considering many another semi-magical instances of world being changed, such as spirits returning to material realm, Kataclysm, and general theming of those, we believe an aspect of truth can still be attributed to those descriptions:

- `visage of beast who some believe created the world in its passing: its fire the sun, its bones the mountains` ([Storm Dragon Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Dragon_Helm#Storm_Dragon_Helm))
- `visage of beast who some believe razed the world in its passing: its rage became magma rain, its breath a typhoon` ([Raging Dragon Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raging_Dragon_Helm#Raging_Dragon_Helm))
- `visage of beast who some believe shaped the world in its passing: its frenzy started the mighty winds, its scales became the shadows` ([Frenzy Dragon Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Dragon_Helm#Frenzy_Dragon_Helm))

Dragons' lifespan is unknown, but as [dragon scales](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale) are present and are capable of withstanding effects of time, while still be used in 5-star alchemy by the Spiral Order, has its own implications of dragons' lifespan, or at least longevity of their armor. At the same time, it is stated that dragons may not be extinct: `An armored scale from what was thought to be an extinct creature`.

As we do not have any other example of a world being created by such means, which would suggest it being a myth with consideration of plausibility of powers seen across the Clockworks, we can consider several interpretations of those:

- If dragons did create the worlds in their passing, this would seem as if their existence is not one of as generally understood lifecycle of species, existing in a different understanding of the word, - as a part of the process of Universe taking its form.

  Them being extinct after this would be interpreted as a myth of their disappearance - a creature powerful enough - so that it would not be present in a world born of their passing. Such interpretation would be similar to a popularized idea of an immortal Chinese dragon.

- If we consider dragons immortal and divine entities, and them being potentially alive to the present-day Cradle, implies that some external force would be present far in the past, that had caused dragons' extinction. This force should be powerful enough to defeat beasts implied to be wielding powers of storms, rage and frenzy, as suggested by riders' mantles.

  [Riders](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle) in that regard could be either literal riders of dragons, or riders of the metaphorical forces. In this case, for now, the latter interpretation seems fitting, due to riders' status as gods, capable to `to carve whole worlds from stone` ([Rider Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle)). In this interpretation, dragons are similar to their germanic, european understanding, wherein dragon is a both an physical obstacle and symbolic element of a story.

### _Chapter `II`_ Underworld

Within Underworld fiendish ecosystem develops. Devilites emerge as one of conscious species, and over time develop a society, existing, as currently known, within corporations. One such corporation is named Undercorp and is related to material realm (`Assistant Supervisor of Resource Allocations, Undercorp` - [Morgral'm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Morgral%27m)) through its presence in the [Ancient Grove](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones/Ancient_Grove).

Underworld is not devoid of elements. Based on fiendish biology and elemental alignment of devilites, subdivisions are formed within the corporate structure:

- Shock-themed devilites form Undercorp's IT department ([Devil-IT](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Devilite#Devil-IT))
- Freeze-themed Layoafers [Layoafer](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Devilite#Layoafer), they are later be trying to establish its own organization at Cradle, separate from Undercorp ([Fiendish Memo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Morgral'm)) with Maulos, a trojan, summoned for unknown means
- [Firebranders](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firebrander#Firebrander) do use magic in order to form fireballs. Their name suggest a branding with fire of others, alluding to form of branding with a hot iron. This symbolism in the context of a corporate setting may be alluded to those devilites being Undercorp security.

Most of overtimers have unique fiendish weaponry - pitchforks and axes, which have a peculiar property of being made of stone-like mineral with visible cracks in areas of connection. The color aligns with base elemental status effects found across Cradle, apart from curse.

The curse status is absent as well as its imagery. Weapons, which do not belong to any status effect have pink color and deal only normal damage. This will be kept in mind for the [intermediate analysis of the curse section](#intermission-analysis-of-curse).

Layoafers and Blarfuls in relation to the rest of corporate hierarchy do not seem to fit in it, rather being outside of it.

#### Dark Cities

Devilite society is developed enough for corporations to exist, and even considered that devilites were from a different intellectual property, they still remain weaved into Spiral Knights cosmology and setting.

It is suggested by Spiral Order, that devilites within dark cities are stranded on Cradle: `It is speculated that all fiends within the Clockworks crossed over from a dimension known as the Underworld. While how they crossed over and what their motives are on Cradle is unclear, data collected from fiendish cities seems to indicate that they are now stranded on Cradle, much like us ... Why spirits return to the material realm is unknown, trough it is clear that many of the spirits within the Clockworks have come from other worlds` ([Weight of Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness)).

Devilites being stranded could mean both spacial and dimensional dislocation, as they had not, compared to Skylark, arrived to Cradle through interstellar travel, but rather summoned or captured with the cities themselves, if dark cities belong to them.

It is also unknown for now weather metaphysics of Cradle itself is the reason for spirits returning into material realm and devilites being stranded - both cases relating to cross-realm transition between material realm and likely Underworld. Moreover, devilites do continuous research to bring back legion of Ur, so the fact they had to use ritual circles as the last measure as suggested by [The Return of Ur]() mission's description `an alternative approach would be required for bringing them back`, implies that the original method is different, one we believe is of Grim Gates, as it is the only other known method of transportation related to devilite technology.

With a high certainty we gather that ritual circles are utilized to summon trojans from the Underworld, as implied by depths' names and their level design - [Plazamonium](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_City/Plazamonium) is referred in the [The Return of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur) as the `Summoning Circle`, followed by the [`Banishment`](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur#Gate_Map), relating to a popularized idea of entities being summoned from an abstract "beyond". Likely, in the case of the Spiral Knights setting, this location is established to be the Underworld.

If the cities were excavated and later integrated into Cradle, devilites by fact of crossing to material realm, should have the technology that would allow them to move back to Underworld, unless it is a one-way operation. The existence of such technology may be affirmed by presence of Grim Gates, which seem to lead to other dark cities.

Yet it is unknown weather those places - dark city's interior, depicted in active Grim Gates portals - are located on Cradle or in the Underworld, or if Grim Gates are so rare that devilites had to utilize regular summoning as in case of Legion of Ur, separate from the events of March of Tortodrones, when those gates are found. Moreover, it could be the case of Legion of Ur being "sealed" - which would potentially forbid Grim Gates from allowing them to pass through. We will analyze and identify those laws of transportation in detail, as for now we group them in order to perceive the general scale of Underworld's presence on Cradle.

Based on ideas of battle sprite relating to Cradle or pre-Cradle history, it can be possible for Core being involved in the process of tempering with realms within the space taken up by Cradle. It must be kept in mind as it is a highly anomalous behavior from Spiral Order point of view, at the same time suggesting that Spiral Order knows about existence of spirits to some degree.

In Heart of Ice, it is stated that city of Amu-Sol belongs to devilites, and has name similar to [fiendish glyphs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_ID_Card#Recipe), ones used to power grim gates - of `Ur`, `Tor`, `Nok`, `Sol`, `Amu`. It is likely that the city itself is of Underworld origin given its name, and was not originally in that shattered state in which it is found, unless the names of the cities were given by devilites after they occupied them, which seems less plausible. For the most part, from the standpoint of corporate theme of devilites, those cities seem to be devilites' main habitat and we will assume them belonging to devilites, rather than any currently undisclosed civilization. This will be our current assumption.

Another city, Sol' Fork, has already established naming pattern: `After Recon Knights discovered a fiendish city known as Sol' Fork, Spiral HQ deployed a research team to station itself in the heart of the city and study the devilites within. Their finding have become the basis for our understanding of devilite culture and their motives for working with gremlins` ([Whipping and Mishandling](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Whipping_and_Mishandling)).

There was a successful operation of bringing both Maulos and everfrost pillar into Underworld, suggesting that some connection, maybe even to a small degree, remains on Cradle, as [Morgral'm's communications](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Morgral%27m) suggest. How grim gates operate in this context we will analyze closer in [later chapter](#arrival-of-undercorp).

At the same time, another proposal in creation to dark cities could be made - as Cradle is implied to collect and integrate other planets, had it integrated some dark cities from a devilite colony from a different planet? This can seem plausible, as it does not change our proposal of dark cities belonging to devilites, and their main base of operation - Undercorp - being located in the Underworld, with the Core functioning as a potential disruption to Undercorp operations, hindering transportation between the realms.

#### Influences of Underworld

The notion is of trojans being summoned by devilites, as described in [The Return of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur): `devilites are attempting to summon a legion of powerful trojan warriors. Based on intel from a devilite internal memo, the trojans are known as the 'Legion or Ur', and are said to have once numbered in the thousands. Strangely, the memo indicated that the Legion of Ur was sealed away in the Underworld and that an alternative approach would be required for bringing them back`, can be viewed in the context of Maulos, as, by the fact of him being a trojan, a chain of events had to transpire in order for Maulos to be created - a unique fiend with relation to everfrost, so far as it is imbued into him in place of the supposed dark matter shard of trojans.

Actions of Maulos and his supposed cult of devilites seem to be not approved by Undercorp:

- `The entirety of Amu-Sol is swarming with frozen souls and deep within the heart of the city lies the source of it all: the cult's powerful leader, Maulos and a towering column of pure everfrost.` ([Patch Notes: Heart of Ice](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/61137))
- `You are receiving this mail as a result of an incorrect/cryptic entry in your recent resource allocation request` ([Heart of Ice - Amu-Sol - Fiendish Memos (from Morgral'm)](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Morgralm))

The operation within the Amu-Sol seemingly went in a different direction, as it was not approved by Undercorp at least at that point in time, as not being related to devilites' attempts to bring back legion of Ur at least at that point in time and cult's progression.

While this idea of Maulos being potentially related to the general plot of Legion of Ur, we will return to them later in the detailed analysis of their nature. As for now, as we make introductory coverage of most Underworld-related entities, and organized at that, we have to point out thematic parallel which can be drawn between the general narratives of:

- Maulos, as a trojan, different from the rest of Legion of Ur
- Maulos's unnatural power of frost: `HR has requested an updated org chart as soon as possible. It is our understanding that all Pit Boss duties, administrative and otherwise, have been turned over to a 'Maulos of the Eternal Frost,'` ([Heart of Ice - Amu-Sol - 'Fiendish Memo'](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Amu-Sol))
- Source of unnatural frost being related to [everfrost](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Everfrost): `A small patch of ice crystals that never seem to melt, even when exposed to direct heat`.
- [Blinding Abyss](#blinding-abyss) as the implied location from which Maulos originates, metaphorical or literal
- [Perma-frostifurs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver#Perma-Frostifur) as deathless and fierce evolutions of [frostifurs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frostifur#Frostifur) and far more powerful than [Alpha-Frostifurs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frostifur#Alpha_Frostifur), relating to themes of permafrost - a classification for a permanently frozen ground under cold climate.
- Trojans
- Underworld, as it is the source of the Everfrost Pillar: `You are receiving this mail as a result of an incorrect/cryptic entry in your recent resource allocation request. Please provide a detailed summary of your projected use of the following requested resources:
... A 'towering pillar' of everfrost and 'all the frozen souls it brings forth'` ([Heart of Ice - Amu-Sol - 'Fiendish Memo'](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Amu-Sol)) and is the only known entity to utilize everfrost for its soul-holding power: `The intel we've collected so far suggests that fiends utilize large deposits of the stuff to trap the souls of the lost within it, like some kind of icy prison. ... It would seem that Maulos, that horrible arch-fiend you just took down, had a different use in mind and was actually destroying this everfrost to unleash swarms of angry, frozen souls into the Clockworks.` ([Heart of Ice - Everfrost Tower - Recon Ranger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Everfrost_Tower)).

And later established and explored themes found within:

- [Lord Vanaduke](#kingdom-of-almire) and his relation to curse.
- [Curse, Darkfire](#nature-of-darkfire) and [unnatural fires](#king-in-the-mountain) as manifestations of influence not from the material realm.
- [Dark embers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember) as the only material related to the nature of the aforementioned fires as not native to material realm.
- Identity of [Vog](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fang_of_Vog) as a entity related to concepts of transformation and fire.
- Absent [Vog cubs implied by fiery wolver coat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vog_Cub_Coat) and yet present [ash tail wolvers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver#Ash_Tail).

The idea which we will explore is of the source of such influences being located in the Underworld, - influences such as `dark gods`: `One of many statuettes carried by fiends as a means of gaining favor with their dark gods` ([Wicked idol](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wicked_Idol)), - not restricted to Vog specifically, rather than making him a most detailed to date example, but in greater scheme **marking Underworld as a major source of unnatural influence onto material realm**, as both Lord Vanaduke's and Maulos's powers have relation to shadow damage, that those powers indeed come from Underworld and deific entities there.

It is not confirmed weather all encountered on Cradle devilites work for Undercorp, but if Morgral'm's memos are to be considered in relation to Heart of Ice, March of Tortodrones and Grim Gates, it is rather likely that Undercorp is at the forefront of crossing into material realm and is the one to which Crimson Order outsources given tasks:

- `Analysis of the data collected from these offices indicates that devilite corporations are outsourced by gremlins in order to design and manage various projects that include weapons specifically engineered to target Spiral Knight squads` ([Work for Idle Hands](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Work_for_Idle_Hands)).
- `Their finding have become the basis for our understanding of devilite culture and their motives for working with gremlins` ([Whipping and Mishandling](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Whipping_and_Mishandling)).

#### Fiendish Cults

Through fiend costume sets it is implied that at least 1 tangible deity exist in the Underworld:

- `A mask said to have been worn by fanatics that worshiped a magma god. Its fires will light the path to victory` ([Magmatic Fanatic](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiend_Mask)).
- `A plated mail said to have been worn by fanatics that worshiped a magma god. Its fires will protect those that are worthy` ([Magmatic Fanatic Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail#Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail)) - [Fire GOOD!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/111013): `burning things while taking on the visage of a fiery deity of martial prowess`
- [Vog Slippers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vog_Slippers#Vog_Slippers) may suggest that Vog is a fiendish entity similar in anatomy to a wolver, as it is grouped with slippers of different families of wolvers of [Cozy Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cozy_Prize_Box), yet there is evidence of this depiction being a vog cub, rather than th e deity itself: `The great fire beast Vog. The great fire beast Vog isn't a wolver himself, but a fiery deity of sorts who embraces some creatures and grants them a bit of power. Vog's 'cubs' are more or less acquired and forced to spread his fiery love across the world` ([Forums - Nick Popovich](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/9995#comment-55776)).

Descriptions of magmatic fanatic armor and helm are very reminiscent of the becoming of Lord Vanaduke, latter explored during the [analysis of Lord Vanaduke](#king-in-the-mountain), and we will propose that it the same powerful entity referred in those cosmetics and analysis of Almire's downfall.

Then, there is a venom fiend:

- `A mask said to be crafted in the visage of a venomous fiend. It is infused with a vile essence that is sure to frighten your foes` ([Venom Fiend](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiend_Mask)).
- `A plated mail said to be crafted in the image of a venomous fiend. It comes with a sinister skin suit that pulses with a vile essence` ([Venom Fiend Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Venom_Fiend_Mail#Venom_Fiend_Mail)).

As the design of the armor is closely similar to the Magmatic set, it is plausible to suggest that a fiend referred here is also a deity - we will label it as a Vile deity. To counter this suggestion, we may refer to the similarities of visual effects of celestial sets from [Equinox Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Equinox_Prize_Box).

To identify those possible deities, other sources must be looked at. Notably, only magmatic and arctic shackles are present across accessories ([Shackles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Shackles#Magmatic_Shackles)), which, though a logical leap, can suggest that some power was responsible for their creation involving frost and magma - both of those elements being to an extent related to Underworld and powers which stem from Underworld's influence. The latter, arctic shackles are acquired from the [Glacial Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Glacial_Prize_Box), which is related both to eldrich identity of Apocrea, explored in the [arctic plot section](#nefarious-imp-arctic-plot).

The placement of those cultists and fanatics will be explored in their [relevant section](#discovery-of-vile-deity).

##### Graveyards

Relevant to the current context in tracking down influences and presence of Underworld are [graveyards](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graveyard).

Within graveyards there are a few distinct features:

- Some tombstones are cracked and have green essence flowing through the cracks in its surface.
- Green fires on crypt walls are unique to this location.
- Graveyards themselves are seem to be located not completely in the material realm, have a motif, later explored in the [Kat Tribe and Kataclysm section](#chapter-viii-kat-tribe): `Graveyards are an unnatural place, a world between worlds where lost souls gather, hungry for the life of any live soul that must pass through` ([Information Module: Graveyard](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Information_Module:_Graveyard)). Our suggestion consists of those locations being in between material realm and Underworld, and are related to the state Cradle is found, connected with the phenomenon of spirits returning to material realm (`Why spirits return to the material realm is unknown, trough it is clear that many of the spirits within the Clockworks have come from other worlds.` - [Weight of Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness)).

The green color motif may be attributed to several supernatural materials:

- `A bit of ectoplasm meticulously collected from an unwilling undead volunteer. its an unpleasant shade of green` ([Ecto Drop](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ecto_Drop))
- `A powerful essence left behind when a creature perishes from a particularly putrid disease` ([Plague Essence](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plague_Essence))

The argument behind plague essence, as its icon was chosen to be of a flame, will tie in with the curse and Vanaduke, specifically, [Dark Ember](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember) being, supposedly, the source of unnatural fires in a similar manner how everfrost is at the foundation of unnatural frost.

Currently, to avoid to much reference to unexplored topic of Almire, it can be safe to suggest, that the essence, that is present within gravestones is the ectoplasm, and, possibly, reason behind [dust zombies](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zombie#Dust_Zombie) having green eyes.

### _Chapter `III`_ Tortomega

From [dragons](#dragons), referred to as `creatures of legend` (`A mythical shield crafted from the scales of a creature of legend` - [Dragon Scale Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale_Shield)), their descendants were born: drakes and potentially wyverns ([Wyvern Scale Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wyvern_Scale_Shield)), explored later in its alchemy path:

- `A helmet crafted from the scales of beasts thought to be the descendants of dragons` ([Drake Scale Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Helm)).
- `Armor forged from the scales of beasts thought to be descendants of dragons` ([Drake Scale Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Mail)).

This establishes drakes as descendants of dragons. Here, an important distinction must be made of dragons as they are described in different cultures. Specifically, it is the differences of a _continental european dragon_ and a _celtic dragon_. It will be important in relation to a further discussed [valkyries of heavenly kingdom](#chapter-iv-valkyries-of-heavenly-kingdom), but before that - for understanding of wyverns and drakes as species.

Germanic and then northern depictions of dragons are _wingless and limbless serpents_, and european dragons are depicted as _winged creatures with 4 legs and a pair of wings_. Here a comparison with drakon battle sprites must be made. _Drakons - battle sprites, - possess front limbs and occasionally wings or large paws, depending on their evolution_. The consistent element is the jagged jaw and a pair of horns on the back of the head.

It can be argued that dragons' canon form had wings based on [dragon wings accessory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Wings), although wings of explicitly storm, rage, and frenzy [do differ](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wings_of_Rage#Wings_of_Rage), resembling the prismatic, artificial counterpart, whose place of all seem to belong to [Rider Mantles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle) due to their thematic parity and slimmer build. Presence of wings as well as overall look of drakon battle sprites could suggest that the dragons in question were of european-inspired appearance, as well as recognizing dragons of frenzy, storm and rage as of unique kind.

Wyverns, as a name suggests, are similar to wyrns or Lindworms - another name for _germanic dragons_, - they have _2 limbs and wings_. In western folklore, drakes were considered same as dragons, but over time the term had changed to characterize _drakes as wingless 4-legged smaller creatures_ related to dragons. It is important to note presence of dragons in alchemy - notably within a concept of union of opposites - represented as a caduceus, closely related to god Mercurius, this idea will be later further developed, as currently an overview of dragons is required in relation to other species.

Previously discussed in the [introduction of dragons](#dragons), [Dragon Scales](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale) are used in crafting of [Dragon Scale set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale_Mail) and [Omega Shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Shell).

The [Omega Shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Shell) mentions Tortomega specie: `shield created from the armor of a Tortomega`. As drakes are not considered flying creatures, they could plausibly serve as ancestors of tortoises and then tortomega, connected by being reptilian and following a theme of divine. As tortoises could be considered descendants of dragons in this cosmology, both dragons and tortoises are considered divine in real-world mythology.

The [Stone Tortoise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stone_Tortoise) shield does not use dragon scales in its alchemy, only [Drake Scales](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale). It seems, that tortoises were related, as reptiles, to drakes and dragons. The presence of [Omega shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Shell) in the same alchemy path from [drake scale shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Shield) and direct upgrade of [Stone Tortoise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stone_Tortoise), may be a hint at tortomega's ancestry.

As descendants of dragons, tortomega were resistant to fire: `A shield alchemized from the shell of a tortodrone. The plates used in its construction provide some protection against the elements of fire and freeze` ([Primal Shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Shell)). Frost is reminiscent of Blinding Abyss and Underworld, but also of real-world tortoises being cold-blooded species and, potentially, referring to s specific tortoise species which live in a cold climate. It is also here we point out ability of tortoise to hibernate in winters, similar to a tortodrone migration: `Now, the tortodrones are being called on the Long Migration. Even the Strangers do not know the reasons for this mysterious event but these giant, robotic tortoises can be glimpsed traveling through the clockworks` ([March of the Tortodrones](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones)).

We propose, that tortomega are the separate, conscious specie, comprising the civilization, responsible for creation of tortodrones. As tortoises are positioned as different specie from tortomega, as it is implied that a significant difference exists for that distinction to be made within the alchemy path. It can be anything starting from anatomical differences, to habitat, or other evolutionary traits as far as drakes differ from tortoises. The name "tortomega" has a postfix of "mega", which must be inspected.

Based on [Merriam-Webster definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mega), "mega" refers to metaphorical or literal scale, power, greatness, which, when observed within the context of tortomega specie, means vaguely a great tortoise or, a giant tortoise.

This definition is also fitting for tortodrones, as they are one of the largest, although artificial, mobile creatures found on Cradle. Tortodrones are bipedal and have large amount of skills and capable powers. Exploration of tortodrones currently goes beyond current discussion, and will be explored in the [tortodrones section](#anatomy-of-tortodrone-and-crimsonite), but an essential conclusion can now be made through the semantics of the alchemy path.

Tortodrones are constructs either built in image of other specie, one implied to be tortomega, or by some different civilization in an image of great beasts - giant tortoises, tortomega. As the latter scenario is uncharacteristic of devilites, as they do not use such themes and symbolisms on regular basis - as seem in the corporate design of grim gates and more primal totems, the first scenario seems to us as thematically fitting. One of _tortodrones being designed in an image of tortomega_.

Another connection, which is important in the context of tortodrones and tortomega is:

- `A terrifying shield that combines the dual-crushing power of a gorgo and the mythical tortomega` [Gorgomega](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgomega), and [Gorgofist](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgofist)
- `A shield created from the armor of a Tortomega` [Omega Shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Shell)

Here a closer look at the alchemy tree must be made: while drakes are descendants of dragons, [Dragon Scale Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale_Shield) is a 5-star upgrade - by this logic [Wyvern Scale Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wyvern_Scale_Shield) could be a specie being at transition of dragons to drakes, but this logic fails as previously established, drakes and wyverns do not belong to a single habitat, one being terrestrial and other aerial. Another way to look at it is the alchemy path and continuous disclosure of ancestry and relations though gear progression from game design perspective. Considering again real world definition of drakes, with addition of tortoise, the latter could be further evolution of drakes. Taking this in account, as well as dragon set alchemy path, [Omega shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Shell) could mean that tortomega are a different specie, related to both dragons and tortoise, based on its naming scheme.

At that same time [chromalisks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chromalisk) emerge. As they lack wings, they also may be descendants of drakes, with wyverns during that time remaining in the skies.

The [Wyvern Scale Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wyvern_Scale_Shield) being in upgrade of [Drake Scale Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Shield) but required for [Dragon Scale Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale_Shield), having [Chroma Tear](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chroma_Tear) as the rest of dragon-themed items, may connect them all under a single ancestry as well as place wyverns as a potential species that either were at a transition to drakes, or older than drakes yet of same dragon ancestry. Despite the ancestry, we must keep in mind the difference in habitat.

Considering this, it may be established that _tortoises were descendants of drakes, which are descendants of dragons_. _Form tortoise tortomega emerged as a different conscious specie while still being ancient reptilian creatures with shells_. Further timeline will be stemming from an idea, that tortomega are conscious, organized specie, a descendants of tortoise, drakes and finally dragons. The logic behind this concept will be discussed next.

#### Tortodrones' Creators

Considering the similarity in naming of tortoises and tortomega and lack of any non-mechanical tortoise creatures, apart from a single stone shell of, supposedly, tortoise, presence of a tortoises is the main hint, through which tortodrone creators' specie may be uncovered.

Here we will advocate for tortodrones being built in image of a bipedal tortomega, as tortodrones themselves, so that tortodrone creators are tortoise-like specie, advanced and skilled enough to engineer and mass-produce those constructs, while discussing other possibilities based on presented in-game content.

##### Gremlin Scenario

The one and only candidate for such specie with engineering skills are gremlins, which would mean, that they are far more ancient than Clockworks makes them seem. And yet, tortodrones don't fit thematically and design-wise to be gremlin creation, as it will be later explored, the themes surrounding tortodrones are of stone megaliths, forests, - Gloaming Wildwoods specifically, - and an established architectural presence. Gremlins in that regard may be linked to grim gates in the Ancient Grove, as those have several mounted monitors of similar gremlin design. On the other hand, this can be further proof of gremlins working with Undercorp in recent times. Tortodrones have a relation to devilites, same as gremlins. Gremlins share a connection with devilites, whom they outsource their work: `Analysis of the data collected from these offices indicates that devilite corporations are outsourced by gremlins in order to design and manage various projects that include weapons specifically engineered to target Spiral Knight squads` ([Work for Idle Hands](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Work_for_Idle_Hands)).

Gun puppies are present within the ruins of wildwoods, sky islands, and scarlet fortress - all of these factors, while seem as compelling evidence for gremlins being said specie, again, does not fit thematically, - that of a relation with graviton/shadow and electron/elemental technology and their placement in relation to different locations within Clockworks. The point regarding gun puppies will be discussed in the [stone constructs section](#stone-constructs).

The rest of connections will will be explored in the [arrival of Undercorp section](#chapter-vi-arrival-of-undercorp), but the gist being the following: graviton technology allows linking of material realm with the Underworld, manipulation of gravity and capacity to inflict otherworldly shadow damage, which had to be in greater development and application, if gremlins adopted it earlier in the timeline. But, the observed focus of gremlin technology is mainly elemental damage and shock. Crimson Order is an exception here, as its' members - Warmaster Seerus specifically (`It is thought to have been reserved for use against other members of the Crimson Order` - [Dark Retribution](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Retribution)), - utilize shadow damaging bombs as well as several [other instances](#cradle-defenses), making shadow damage seem as of greater danger and secrecy within gremlin society.

An important note should be made: if gremlins did engineer tortodrones present on Cradle, that would mean that Clockworks were built either during that time or after, but remained within realm of gremlin influence, which would not explain presence of the Great Colony in a sense that colonies are not the homeworlds, but a dependent regions controlled externally and established by a greater empire of that specie, with an assigned emperor or a king. One entity close to this concept is implied to exist king Tinkinzar. The truthfulness of Tinkinzar's existence will be explored later in [chapter on gremlins](#gremlin-empire). In the context of tortodrones, this would mean, that gremlins salvaged this regions for Cradle while being present there.

This idea makes gremlins seem as less plausible candidate for tortodrones' creators, as there are tortomega themselves. Based on ideas, discussed earlier, - mainly a distinction between tortoise and tortomega, - they may seem as a more likely candidate, compared both to gremlins and devilites.

##### Devilite Scenario

While remaining at that point of analysis it is important to address another element of the setting, connected both to devilites and tortodrones - shining sigils found within the [Call of the Colossi](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Call_of_the_Colossi).

Those sigils, or rather ritual circles, have same symbols that are used by devilites, but, in case of tortodrones, their parts and even shells are surrounded in much simpler design-wise circles of a _pale white mineral_.

Considering overall design of those circles, even outside of the meaning of devilite ritual circles, but considering presence of dark matter corrupted tortodrones, this _seems more of a measure to protect deactivated tortodrones from tampering_, utilizing same magic as devilites themselves use, and, as later will be seen, [undead Kat Tribe](#kat-tribe) in the Moorcroft Manor.

Excluding devilites themselves as potential creators of tortodrones, from the fact that they had to tempter with the constructs in the first place, only a civilization with similar knowledge of minerals can exist, which would assemble tortodrones with those physics in mind. This demonstrates, that the technology underlying tortodrones is similar to one of devilites, but not exact, suggesting a 2 scenarios:

- Devilites would adapt tortodrones to utilize not dark matter, but as later seen, crimsonite, while remaining in the physics of minerals.
- A different civilization has a potential to work with devilites, as gremlins did, to create tortodrones, while utilizing prior's knowledge of _minerals as power sources_.

##### Isoran Scenario

Isorans also should be noted as a potential lead, as suggested by shape of [Ancient Plate Mail/Set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Armor) as well as `items fashioned in the ancient, veiled homeland of the tortodrones` ([Ancient Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Prize_Box)), which do fit anatomy of Isorans, so they had to uncover existence of tortomega at some point in time. This suggestion frames civilization behind Spiral Order as creators of tortodrones and were inhabiting at some point in time a remote land, referred as the veiled homeland.

Even if tortodrones came from a different planet, captured by the Core, a connection with devilites and technological advancement would be recorded by the specie as they should be developed enough for such complex construction begin. And yet, Spiral HQ is unaware of any more information regarding tortodrones. Although this idea won't be completely discarded, overall and widespread presence of Isorans does not seem accurate, as there are a few other species present, suggests that some other civilization had invented tortodrones.

##### Tortomega Scenario

At last, there remains a duality in the theme of limitless rage of tortodrones and their veiled, serene even, as suggested by the [serene naming convention of ancient items](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Prize_Box), homeland. This duality must be kept in mind for further mechanical analysis of tortodrones and corrupted tortodrones. Notions and inconsistencies discussed above make tortomega as one remaining specie, plausible skilled enough to engineer tortodrones.

#### Symbolism of Stone

There are a few references to titans in a context of either heavy armors or armors made of stone:

- `A suit of artifact armor that is said to have been worn by titans` ([Ancient Plate Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Armor)).
- `A vestigial helm whose weight makes it unwieldy to all but those with titanic strength` ([Ancient Plate Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Helm)).
- `items fashioned in the ancient, veiled homeland of the tortodrones` ([Ancient Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Prize_Box)).
- Mossy design of [Troika](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Troika), similar to other ancient-themed items. Despite Troika having Spiral Order variant, as well as wielded by Spiral Order - by [Izola in the Hall of Heroes](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Izola), - it seems this design was acquired rather recently, after Skylark crash-landed on Cradle, compared to different themes of items in the alchemy path of [Cobalt armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cobalt_Armor), given that these equipment is upgraded with the Knight's rank mission progression.
- `A large, powerful shield made to resemble a creature's shell` ([Stone Tortoise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stone_Tortoise)). The creature in question is a tortoise.
- Design of [Omega Shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Shell) points at Tortomega. Tortomega is mentioned and is of same design as [Stone Tortoise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stone_Tortoise), albeit darker, purple even.
- `A legendary suit of armor said to imbue the wearer with the rage of the titans` ([Rageous Plate Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rageous_Plate_Mail#Rageous_Plate_Mail)) - another instance of link between rage and titans, but here also a connection to older interpretations elements, relation to normal damage and rage.
- Stone is mentioned in [Stone Tortoise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stone_Tortoise) and in the Ancient Plate Mail and Helm, as well as costumes of the same ancient design:

  `Within the cool, stony interior of this helmet` [Serene Tailed Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Serene_Tailed_Helm) and [Ancient Plate Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Shield) on a first glance may not fit to an establish design pattern, by presence of, we believe, spirals and energy symbol, as they are associated with Spiral Order's alchemy and technology of their shields. We will return to this symbol in relation to its placement on armors dueing our lter analysis of [Haven mining operations]().

  This similarity to Spiral Order designs is also present in Valkyrian armors, such as [Heavenly Iron Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Helm) and its 5-star alternatives in the alchemy tree of [Angelic Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angelic_Helm), having same Energy symbol and overall shape suggesting anatomical and cultural similarities of Spiral Order and Valkyries, although the species are distinguished from each other: `It retains many divine properties celestial beings possess but lacks their weakness to fire` ([Heavenly Iron Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Helm)). Could it be, that valkyries are related to Spiral order over the different periods of time?

Based on those references to stone and titans, a link may be established between said titans, stone, tortodrones, as their exterior is made of stone, gun puppies, tortoise, and finally, tortomega.

Based on counterarguments presented in favour of gremlins, Isorans or devilites being tortodrones' creators, we believe, due to this common theme of stone, tortomega have most potential to being that species, despite the presented vagueness of both their identity and the time period in question.

Yet, this does not explain naming convention of titans, mentioned a few times in the above descriptions. We see them as relating to stone, which places them with the rest of this ancient time period. The name itself, titans, creates cultural associations from mythology, such as _jotun, giants of norse mythology_, _titans of greek mythology_, and potentially, _fomorians of irish mythology_. The latter will make sense later in the analysis as several common motifs will be found relating to all of the interpretations of giants/titans in the setting.

It is due to this narrative we will consider tortomega as the titans, mentioned in the equipment discussed earlier.

So far at this point of the analysis we will consider **tortomega being this extinct not species, but an entire civilization of titans, responsible for existence of tortodrones**.

#### Veiled Tortodrone Homeland

Tortomega would settle in the [Ancient Grove](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Grove) (`Contains various unique items fashioned in the ancient, veiled homeland of the tortodrone` [Ancient Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Prize_Box)), where their ruins are, reminiscent of the style of carvings on tortodrones and [related gear, alchemized from the ancient shells](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Shell#Usage).

We suggest that Ancient Grove is part of the Gloaming Wildwood, and all of the woods were inhabited by this civilization, of tortomega.

This can be proven by both locations contain same type of architecture, evident by stone gun puppy statues and unique glowing mushrooms present across the biomes. The same statues and mushrooms are present in the [Starlight Cradle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlight_Cradle). Then, only statues remain in the [Aurora Isles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aurora_Isles) and [Wolver Dens](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver_Den), suggesting that prior to Cradle dividing those locations and placing them into skydomes, all of them were close in proximity within a territory inhabited by tortomega, close enough for glowing mushrooms to spread, as well by the same architecture, built by somebody inhabiting the geographical region.

It must be also noted, as Starlight Cradle, Gloaming Wildwoods and Aurora Isles all have large blocks made of dark stone with the glowing valestone-like spiral carved in its' sides, glowing only at night time of encompassing the regions skydomes.

It is unknown weather those regions could be considered as the `veiled homeland`, so it might be that the entirety of the habitat is left unseen and greater than suggested by areas available from the Clockworks, as evident by wildwood, not all of them are encased into Clockworks' skydomes. This idea of a greater volume of Clockworks remaining unexplored is also vaguely pointed out by Biotech in the haven Lab regarding Almire: `there were massive citadels housing Almire's armed forces and great estates for its noble houses ... We assume the kingdom is still a smoldering ruin somewhere`, that is, if the "somewhere" is on Cradle, rather than a lost planet, from which the landmass kingdom was taken into Cradle.

#### Extinction of Dragons

At some point in time, dragons were hunted by currently unknown party, which gave rise to the [creation myth](#creation-myth).

With dragons overthrown, whose powers reshaped the planet (`created the world in its passing: its fire the sun, its bones the mountains` - [Storm Dragon Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Dragon_Helm#Storm_Dragon_Helm)) changing terrain (`its rage became magma rain, its breath a typhoon` [Raging Dragon Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raging_Dragon_Helm#Raging_Dragon_Helm)) and creating storms.

The [Rider Mantles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Rider_Mantle#Frenzy_Rider_Mantle) refer to 3 gods using their respective elements to `carve worlds from stone` - the meaning of carving worlds from stone may also refer to a construction of castles found within Clockworks. The notion of gods is often accompanied with divinity which for the most part is symbolized by the heavenly kingdom - this possible relation will be kept in mind and serves as a basis for this mostly speculative section.

But, to achieve further progress in identification of both tortodrones and tortomega, we should approach from a point of the analysis of a different civilization - valkyries of heavenly kingdom.

Overall designs of [Rage Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rage_Prize_Box), [Stormy Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stormy_Prize_Box), and [Frenzy Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Prize_Box) suggest existence of a different faction. This group's designs differ greatly from any tortomega stonework designs, and are most similar to Valkyrian and Spiral Order gear in respective themes and designs:

- `A helm worm by heavenly guardians who watch over a kingdom hidden atop a snow-covered/magma-covered/wind-swept mountain` ([Avenger Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Avenger_Helm))
- `A beautiful helm made to resemble a heavenly guardian` ([Angelic Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angelic_Helm))
- `A priceless helmet whose name denizens of the Underworld dare not mention` ([Valkyrie Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Helm)) and the above have the very similar designs, including imagery of a spiral, and refer to a particular kingdom with theme of heaven.
- `The helm of one who defied the gods and stormed/razed the gates of a heavenly kingdom` ([Champion Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Champion_Helm)), suggests an existence of a faction possessing same elements as `heavenly guardians` ([Angelic Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angelic_Helm)), but being at war with them.

  It is mentioned that the helm belongs to `one who defied the gods`, and [Rider Mantles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle) suggest that those belong to 3 gods of familiar elements. The helm of one defying itself is extremely similar to [Ancient Plate Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Helm) whose belonging was rather ambiguous due to conflicting origin and themes. Despite this relation, it remains an outlier due to sharing of 3 elements with the valkyrian equipment, as a single or potentially 3 entities defying gods of the according elements.

  Another possible party, who can be seen as a candidate for ones storming the gates of heavenly kingdom is the [Kat Tribe](#kat-tribe), as it succeeded in its endeavour to siege Owlite Academy of Magics. Although currently this is only a speculation based of the most generalized similarities, not the themes, as elemental and divine designs of 3 elements does not fit the curse-adjacent themes of Kats and their armor designs, at least in armors' transmuted forms acquired from the mysterious alchemy station.

- [Rider Mantles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle) have prismatic elements incorporated in their designs, specifically, [Wings of those element](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wings_of_Fury#Wings_of_Fury) or [regular prismatic wings](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wings).
- Sigils on [rider mantles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle) do not resemble anything else seen on Cradle, even fiendish sigils or [Owlite enchanted symbols](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Enchanter_Aura-Equipped.png).
- `A brilliant, white helm belonging to a heavenly warrior` ([Heavenly Guardian Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Guardian_Helm)), - it has Spiral Order energy symbol and design similar to [Azure Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Helm)/[mighty cobalt helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mighty_Cobalt_Helm), this may also connect heavenly kingdom and Spiral Order as from the same if not similar time period, or possibly being related.

  Can it be that past Spiral Order was of those exact heavenly warriors? Considering the design, [Divine Avenger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Avenger) it might have been created during that period of time, but presence of curse symbolism contradicts it. It is important to note here, that Spiral Order, one that comes from Isora, does not have mastery of elemental damage, as evident by [Archilus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Archilus): `Elemental resistant armor and shields are adapted from Owlite technology. Though the Owlites themselves no longer exist, their amazing elemental mastery lives on in this gear`, but their technology allows for curse to be lifted through [Remedy](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pickups#Capsules) - if we consider this mechanic diegetic.

  If Spiral Order was at some point related to heavenly kingdom, it must have happened far into the past, if not fully unrelated, which would require then an in-depth explanation for the design similarities. The latter scenario is possible if the equipment is adapted literally - in its designs and culture of Spiral Order on Cradle, with the original designs remaining currently unknown, with a hint being more strategic equipment, such as [cobalt armors](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cobalt_Armor) and [padded armors](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Padded_Armor), which thematically are different from mythological themes heavenly warriors. We will keep this paradox in mind, until we will cover both parties.

Based on a design of [Gilded Griffin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin) and its description: `A beautiful pistol named after a great, noble beast. Its golden frame was believed to provide light within the impenetrable darkness of the Underworld`, - there must have been an Underworld present, if only this handgun was of later times, as well as referring to a griffin - it has anatomy similar to a dragon, especially with its recognizable muzzle, now having 4 legs and wings, and back horns reminiscent of the Drakon sprite. This _notion of depicting ancient and powerful creatures is present also within castles' architecture_, as their origins are also have to be discussed, but the similarity in designs may bring heavenly kingdom and those castles closer in their common origin. While the handgun itself serves here as a reference for dragons and griffins, we will return to it in the context of location its [creation in the timeline](#gunslinger-priests).

Based on what could those handguns be attributed to valkyries? Those handguns possess multiple damage types, while Spiral Order of modern times is mostly unaware of shadow damage, and barely, of elemental, fully relying only on normal and piercing damage, as during times of Morai wars.

Regarding a scenario of Isorans being the heavenly kingdom in question - not enough clues currently are present for them to be such, apart from a similarity in design of the gear, specifically [the Spiral](#concept-of-spiral), which will be covered in relation to Spiral Order.

#### War of Dragons and Valkyries

As dragons perished, their influence was unleashed and documented as the [creation myth](#creation-myth). Then we have suggested that tortomega seemingly inherited the aspect of rage as those are descendants of dragons.

So far no other civilization is present on Cradle, which might have had similar designs to [Rider mantles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle) apart from valkyries. Due to this, we propose, that [Rider mantles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle) do belong to heavenly kingdom of valkyries. It is then a question of what has happened back then in order for those gods to exists, to `carve worlds from stone` ([Rider mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle)).

Due to name of valkyries itself, as well as the name of heavenly kingdom, we suspect, that Valkyries had managed to attain godhood through those powers of storms, rage and frenzy (`A legendary suit of armor thought to be worn by a god` - [Rider Mantles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Rider_Mantle#Storm_Rider_Mantle)). it is then a question of how this transpired, with a suggestion of a war, which had led to dragons paradoxically being extinct while allowing for a world to be created from their innate power. This, for now paradoxical nature, we believe, point to a specific theme within ancient myths.

- `An enchanted helm crafted into the visage of beast who some believe created the world in its passing: its fire the sun, its bones the mountains` ([Storm Dragon Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Dragon_Helm#Storm_Dragon_Helm)).
- `An enchanted helm crafted into the visage of beast who some believe shaped the world in its passing: its frenzy started the mighty winds, its scales became the shadows` ([Frenzy Dragon Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Dragon_Helm#Frenzy_Dragon_Helm)).
- `An enchanted helm crafted into the visage of beast who some believe razed the world in its passing: its rage became magma rain, its breath a typhoon` ([Raging Dragon Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raging_Dragon_Helm#Raging_Dragon_Helm)).

This war to dragons as beings to hold or contain power to allow world to be made, and heavenly kingdom may be seen as a similar concept established in the _Mesopotamian epic - The Battle between Marduk and Tiamat_, and the _Babylonian creation myth - Enuma Elish_, and a greater idea, also found in alchemy - of order emerging from chaos, as described in the [initial covered of the Nameless Realm](#nameless-realm).

Goddess Tiamat is associated with the primordial chaos and sea, but only later she is described as a serpent. She was defeated by Marduk, implied to be the god of thunderstorms. After her defeat, her body was split by Marduk in two halves. From them, heavens and earth were created.

This seems as a possible inspiration for the [creation myth](#creation-myth) involving dragons. The interpretation of Goddess Tiamat as a dragon, as previously stated, was a later development, but it is one interpretation that has settled in popular culture, specifically in the universe of "Dungeons and Dragons". We believe this is important, as is known that some inspiration from a existing fictional works were initially taken as the inspiration, later developed and build upon: `Haven's original look resembled something similar to a Ald'ruhn from The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind. As you might imagine, it really didn't look right` ([10 things you didn't know about Spiral Knights](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/20773)). It is also in relation to the lore of Elder Scroll, dragons are considered primordial entities, responsible for the existence and form of its cosmology, and later being hunted by Nords, who initially were worshipping dragons.

Considering those themes, we suggest, that dragons were hunted by valkyries of heavenly kingdom.

#### Castles

As later seen by [stone constructs](#stone-constructs), tortomega had skills to construct defenses, traps, and gun puppies. As all of those constructs are present within most of castles, notably [Scarlet Fortress](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scarlet_Fortress). It can be argued that flying Scarlet Fortress has no connection to Tortomega, but the common and shared architecture itself suggest, that somebody had to carve it consistently over the construction of those castles. Potentially even tortomega assistance in castles' construction. This vagueness must be kept in mind as we will return to the relation of tortodrones to Underworld.

Both Gloaming Wildwoods, as an instance of assumed tortomega civilization, and castles, have similar imagery and depictions of dragons. Yet castles and discussed earlier equipment are implied to belong to heavenly kingdom, as only latter have more fine-grained depictions of dragons, a sign of possible acculturation of both civilization or taking inspiration directly from dragons.

The scenario would seem fitting in the case of tortomega being similar or partially inspired by Fomorians from Irish mythology, specifically in their role as ancient opposition to a divine across Ireland. This motif we cover in the [Fomorians section](#fomorians-and-irish-mythology), as a later explanation for the _single eye symbolism of the titan gates of the Arcade_.

A disappearance of tortomega civilization at some point had happened, same as dragons, remaining only in crafting materials and environment. Different reason for their extinction can be discussed:

- Being defeated by Heavenly Kingdom. Although it is implied by Spiral Order, that it is Underworld who led to creators of tortodrones' downfall: `leading Spiral HQ to believe that the Fiends are somehow linked to the disappearance of those once-mythical beings. In order to discover what the Fiends are up to, you will need to find a way to unlock one of their Grim Gates and travel through it` ([March of the Tortodrones](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones_(Mission)>)).
- Tortomega were ones of the Heavenly Kingdom, but that would conflict with the established themes of celestial kingdom belonging to Owlites, a we will discuss in [their own analysis](#owlites-and-valkyries-of-heavenly-kingdom).

  This is a major roadblock, as we will later see, the heavenly kingdom is the Owlite and Valkyrie kingdom, which had established itself within the floating structures of the Scarlet Fortress, that is, if the heavenly kingdom was not of tortomega and later reestablished, recontextualised by valkyries - as this seems far more unlikely.

There are a few possible ways to resolve this:

- Valkyries of heavenly kingdom are as ancient as tortomega civilization.
- The heavenly kingdom is recontextualised. That is the heavenly kingdom of dragons - `The helm of one who defied the gods`, as the gods are either dragons ones with that same power as stated in [Rider Mantles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raging_Rider_Mantle#Raging_Rider_Mantle): `A legendary suit of armor thought to be worn by a god who used rage to carve whole worlds from stone`.

_It seems as if there were indeed multiple, separated by culture creation myths, and yet, they are retellings of a singular timeline of events, obscured by mythology of each culture and civilization_.

Apart from heavenly kingdom, there are Owlites, which had inhabited halls of almost the same architecture, - of the Owlite Academy of magics. Owlites are associated with vengeance and divinity (`Wielding it fills you with righteous vengeance` [Grey Owlite Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Owlite_Shield)). Apart from it, the [divine themed](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine) items and gear, including [Heavenly Guardian Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Guardian_Armor), would not match to any of the presented currently civilizations. So the possibility of heavenly kingdom being related to Owlites is still there, moreover, highly likely and will be discussed [later](#owlites-and-valkyries-of-heavenly-kingdom). As of now, Owlites are brought up as ones inhabiting a location of similar architecture, of castles.

The sigils of riders' mantles must be pointed out, as they are unique. There also exists a set of sigils, seemingly related specifically to Owlites - [the enchanted aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Enchanter_Aura-Equipped.png). Those sigils are more similar to regular devilite sigils, but the aura itself is present only within a roster of Owlite items, suggesting that it, if related, comes from a seemingly different period of time, one resulting of Owlite research. Considering it, then, those sigils will be kept in mind when analyzing possible interactions of heavenly kingdom and Underworld, such as [sealing of legion of Ur within Underworld](#legion-of-ur) and overall Owlites' advancements regarding darkness at [times of Kat Tribe invasion and Kataclysm](#chapter-viii-kat-tribe).

Within castle halls images of dragons were carved, these castles are the following:

- The [Scarlet Fortress](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scarlet_Fortress) - one of larger castles, as it takes up entire in-game skybox. This would fit with the idea of a kingdom in the sky, or hidden on top of the mountains, as stated by [Avenger Helms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Avenger_Helm): `heavenly guardians who watch over a kingdom hidden atop a ... mountain`.

  Scarlet fortress is stated to be `drifting endlessly in the void of the clockworks`, and as evident by presence of spookats, was at some point in possession of Owlites and possibly valkyries. So this ability of flight, if not granted by the Clockworks, may be of innate laws of cosmology.

  There are some examples of floating structures:

  - `A latent strand of energy that floats throughout the Clockworks ... its too large to properly distill into Energy` ([Static Clinger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Clinger)).
  - `massive negative energy anomaly has surfaced above the Core ... mass of negative energy` ([Ending in Fire - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kora)).

- [Royal Jelly Palace](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Palace)
- [Cryptic Statuary](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Silent_Legion/Cryptic_Statuary)
- [Owlite Academy](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite)/[Candlestick Keep](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Candlestick_Keep)
- [Moorcroft Manor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Moorcraft_manor)
- [Gauntlet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Gauntlet/Last_Stand), or rather, [arenas](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arena) in general, all have a unique red and brown tapestry, yet possessing architecture of Scarlet Fortress and of other aforementioned castles.

Based on this, as well as overall state of the castles, it is plausible that the main part of the heavenly kingdom of valkyries, with its unique tapestry and carpet designs, represented as a [tower, bastion, or a rook](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scarlet_Fortress), if [Owlite/Candlestick keep](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Candlestick_Keep) icon and chess theme to be considered, _belongs to a greater structure in possession of valkyries, as part of physical heavenly kingdom carved from stone, considering the size of the Scarlet Fortress alone_.

##### Crypts

Castle-related locations, such as Owlite Academy and Moorcroft Manor do have crypt-like locations, reminiscent of crypts within the [Inner Sanctum](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Inner_Sanctum) of legion of Almire, although not currently related apart from relation to burial, might point to culture's traditions and customs.

Although establishment of crypts within the former Owlite Academy and Moorcroft Manor would seem fitting for valkyries as a warring species, if attempting to rely on norse mythology, its burial customs does not seem to be present here nor to match event through the lens of interpretation and derived inspiration, which further suggests existence of multiple sources of inspiration behind present civilizations.

Regarding burial traditions, there are graveyards, which have same designs of coffins as in, for example, Moorcroft Manor and [Inner Sanctum](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Inner_Sanctum), possibly suggesting that burial customs either had changed over time, of role of those structures was different. This temporal aspect must be kept in mind for the analysis of the [fiendish statues](#fiendish-statues) designs.

Overall theme of heavenly kingdom and valkyries seem to point that the kingdom in question and valkyries being its guardians, is a stand-in for, fittingly, Valhalla, with themes of afterlife being present across many of their structures. While that seems possible, the strata of coffins must yet to be analyzed.

As it was covered earlier in the [graveyards section](#graveyards), those places by design seem to be heavily related to Underworld. While there was no, under current theory, established connection between valkyries and Underworld explicitly, there is still a question remains behind builders of those places.

In that context, the size of the coffins does differ. Notably, within hall of heroes, behind [Sylvin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sylvin). This coffin seemingly was build to house figures of knights' stature. If those coffins exist, while remaining the same shape and model, what can be said about other instances of such coffins present across Owlite Academy and Graveyards?

The most prominent evidence of Almire using large coffins was in the end of Legion of Almire - [Inner Sanctum](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire/Inner_Sanctum) and [Cryptic Cache](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire/Cryptic_Cache). There is also Torin's, warrior or Almire, [tier 2 and 3 scenario room](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-Graveyard_variant.jpg) - the coffin there is large.

Very likely the entirety of the necropolis did belong to Almire, as there are texts and tomes found within the sanctum, which itself is built seemingly by people of Almire, and not of a previous civilization.

As regarding graveyards themselves and Moorcroft Manor, the burials are same as of Almire. Moreover, zombies are found within Candlestick Keep. This is important due to the fact that all undead warriors of Almire have practically the same skull shape and features, with only [Carnavon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zombie#Carnavon) and [Slag Walker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zombie#Slag_Walker) having armor equipped, and both seen in the Firestorm Citadel.

Carnavons are also present in relation to summoned Black Kats, which are known to gain powers from consuming auras (`They carry the heaviest curse of all and mindlessly seek to devour magical auras. This constant consuming of power makes them incredibly strong` - [Pembrooke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke#Dialogue)), a key component of a living being on par with the soul, and capable of summoning curse-ridden undead. This aspect connects Almire, their civilization, and builders of castles.

Then, what kind of connection did Heavenly kingdom and Almire share, separated by many years? This will be explored later, but currently, this oddity will be kept in mind.

##### Draconic designs, Tortomega, Norse Mythology

Draconic and potentially devilite imagery is widespread in that architecture. It is similar to _Dragestil or Viking architecture, wherein dragon, or rather, serpent motifs are present in similar manner, as observed across Scarlet Fortress, Owlite Academy, etc._ Dragons in norse mythology symbolize chaos and destruction, which is why they were often used to decorate Viking longships.

In relation to dragons and further draconic designs, [Cryptic Statuary](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Silent_Legion/Cryptic_Statuary) and [Royal Jelly Palace](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Palace) have the least of many draconic features, as well as being separated from the main mass of castles, freely floating across Clockworks, uncontained within the own skydomes or skyboxes as Scarlet Fortress.

A handgun, [Raptor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raptor): `An ancient pistol imbued with enchantments designed to smite the fiendish creatures of the Underworld`, and [Gilded Griffin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin) both have draconic designs, but here they are referred as _raptors and griffins_. Both handguns have piercing damage, suggesting, as previously mentioned, that their targets are in fact fiends or beasts, meaning that either Underworld must have been uncovered at that point, or dragons, under Spiral Order classification were beasts. But, due to the descriptions, the latter interpretation does not fit here.

If we to take those norse mythology inspirations, and apply them to tortomega, it may be that they are a stand-in for Jotun - a race of giants, opposing rest of families of gods - Aesir and Vanir of norse myths relating to valkyries. Jotun inhabiting woods, shores and mountains, seems to parallel to tortoise and tortomega inhabiting wildwoods and possibly mountains, as well as what preceded Aurora Isles.

At some point in time those castles were, as stated earlier, attacked by force with the same power of frenzy, rage and storms, with the main body of the heavenly kingdom remaining as it is, populated by Owlites, evident by spookats. Spookats are remnants of Kat Tribe known to invade Owlite High Academy of Magics, meaning that prior to [Kataclysm](#causes-of-kataclysm), it was under control of Owlites, and as we will explore, Valkyries. Then there would not be any reason for kats to go there apart from seemingly not guarded [eternal study](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Edger):

- [Owlite Academy](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite)/[Candlestick Keep](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Candlestick_Keep)
- [Scarlet Fortress](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scarlet_Fortress)
- [Moorcroft Manor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Moorcraft_manor)

Notably, all of location supposedly belonging to heavenly kingdom, except for Owlite Academy and Scarlet Fortress lack stone heads carved instead of fire bowls, with only dragon heads remaining in the arches.

The latter having significant similarity to Drakon battle sprites as in mentioned earlier idea of drakon sprites were shaped by the Core into an image of dragons, whose square muzzles were the main point of connection and similarity.

##### Fiendish statues

It is important to address the design of busts present within castles' halls of Scarlet Fortress, Owlite Academy and Moorcroft Manor:

- The stone on statue's forehead resembles the [Prismatic Dazzling Gem](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Prismatic_Dazzling_Gem), which is related to Kats through idea of battle sprites being reincarnations of past civilizations. In that case being [Seraphynx](#seraphynx).
- The eyes most resemble [devilite yesmen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Yesman) with their circular, dot-like shape, and small pits beneath, outlining the eye sockets.
- The mouth is also similar to devilites, having central tooth and 2 on each side. Based on [yesmens'](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Yesman#Yesman) underbite and other [devilite overbite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Yesman#Devilite) within the textures, the lower jaw has 2 front teeth and upper jaw has 3 with one in the middle, similar to the statue.

But, as no devilites were encountered at that point in time, this architectural development could be some time later, during the time of [arrival of Undercorp to Cradle](#chapter-vi-arrival-of-undercorp), as proven by future appearances of Grim Gates. This conflicts with the proposed idea of tortomega not yet uncovering Underworld and constructing tortodrones, as described at [Arrival of Undercorp chapter](#chapter-vi-arrival-of-undercorp), as that was precursor to titans being extinct.

Across cultures, tall foreheads as well as presence of jewelry signifies wisdom, this can be applied both to dragons and devilites:

- Known devilites does not fashion themselves with trinkets presented on the statues.

  Although, this could be a time before Undercorp could have been established in a more modern setting of a corporation, or a fact that most of encountered devilites are white-collar workers (`The office minions of the Underworld are a disgruntled lot, attacking any unauthorized personnel on sight. While not terrible threats on their own, they can become far worse if one of their Pit Bosses gets a hold of them` [Devilish Drudgery - Information Module](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Information_Module:_Devilish_Drudgery)), without giving insight into the inner details of Underworld's society.

- If statues are of dragons, then it would be a different depiction of them, - with a greater relation to the Underworld's anatomy and physiology, or, it makes Underworld to appear very early in the timeline. It would also mean, that both titans and valkyries could be those castles' builders, given presence of dragons.
- If statues are of devilites or fiends, then it would seem strange for valkyries to build them, notably near crypts in the Moorcroft Manor.

  While for titans, which will later [cooperate with devilites](#arrival-of-undercorp), it would seem more fitting, as valkyries are not connected with shadow damage and Underworld until much further in the timeline we propose. And, as no Underworld was yet discovered, and valkyries do oppose it (`helmet whose name denizens of the Underworld dare not mention` - [Valkyrie Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Helm)), this seems as questionable design choice.

  Unless this was a later development. We consider this scenario as all of those locations lasted the most, as they are populated by Spookats - evidence of Kat Tribe invading those location, meaning, that Owlites were there. And at that, far later point of the timeline, heavenly kingdom would've encountered devilites is several times. Carving them within their halls may be a symbolic gesture of a [yet-to-happen Valkyrian onslaught into the Underworld](#war-of-heavenly-kingdom-and-underworld). But, this suggestion does not follow any so far related myths nor their narratives, Valkyries of norse mythology included, - due to this, such suggestion of devilites being carved into the walls seems as a speculation, rather than a hypothesis.

- A possibility also exists of the castles being built by Spiral Order ancestors, but that would mean that all knowledge of elemental and shadow damage would at some point gone from Spiral Order, as they explicitly discover it on Cradle - shadow damage from devilites, and elemental from Owlites - as it will be discussed in [chapter on Isorans and Spiral Order](#similarity-to-heavenly-kingdom).
- An option, one that was mentioned in the [Ancient Titans chapter](#chapter-iii-ancient-titans) is based on an idea, that those are titans, depicting themselves at some point in time.

  This would lead to and idea, initially suggested by [dragon scale](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale) description: `It reflects light with an otherworldly sheen`, that dragons are related to Underworld to a degree of being able to pass through it.

  While this would conflict with the established design of dragons, the potential designs of titans and tortoises, as similar to fiends design-wise would be not so far plausible.

  The key element is the [dazzling gem](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dazzling_Gem)-like jewelry, which those castles were carved by valkyries, would mean that underworld is a different relation, but no such relation was discovered.

  On the other hand, such decorations for the depictions of builders of those structure would seem as more plausible, if we are to draw parallels with norse mythology - of gratitude and respect to titans, as builder of heavenly kingdom, an interpretation of the complex relationship between giants and valkyries from the norse mythology.

  This would place titans into close proximity of Underworld ecosystem and grant anatomy reminiscent of fiends, while not being as such. This hypothesis could explain the anatomy being similar to devilites'.

The only conflict is that devilites' flat anatomy of a face, rather that a dragon muzzle depicted here, with a stone similar to dazzling gem, which is attributed to Owlites. As anatomy of dragons is established, this makes this statues seem to belong to a different specie, likely titans themselves or devilites of later times in history of heavenly kingdom. We won't discard other cases of the statues' identities, but in order to move forward, we will consider titans as ones depicted on those statues.

This ability of dragons to travel across realms can also explain the scenario, where Isorans did not originate on Cradle nor on planet that was captured by Cradle, but rather on an unrelated planet, implied to be Isora, wherein dragons were already present, as stated by the [Azure Guardian Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Helm): `The technique which weaves dragon scale seamlessly into the metal is a closely guarded secret`. The presence of Riders as once carving worlds from stone in this interpretation can be attributed to a different builders - this time being valkyries, meaning that the **castles with fiendish statues were assisted in building by titans, and the rest of castles build by valkyrian riders, gods**. This would respect both descriptions of riders as well as propose a plausible explanation for the statues, alluding to norse mythology.

Moreover, this exact narrative seems as the closest to the myth of how Asgard of the norse mythology was build - with an assistance of giants:

<BookCitation source="New World Encyclopedia: Asgard">
  {#snippet markup()}

  Describing the red band in the rainbow, the Prose Edda suggests that "that which thou seest to be red in the bow is burning fire; the Hill-Giants might go up to heaven, if passage on Bifr√∂st were open to all those who would cross."(11. Snorri Sturluson, Gylfaginning XV, Brodeur, 28.) This, the constant threat of invasion by the hostile giants (Jotun), represented a genuine fear for the Aesir.

  ---

  In the mythic texts, the Aesir are thought to have constructed Asgard at some point in the mythic past. As Snorri suggests, "In the beginning [Odin] established rulers, and bade them ordain fates with him, and give counsel concerning the planning of the town; that was in the place which is called Ida-field, in the midst of the town. It was their first work to make that court in which their twelve seats stand, and another, the high-seat which Allfather himself has. That house is the best-made of any on earth, and the greatest; without and within, it is all like one piece of gold; men call it Gladsheim." (16. Gylfaginning XIV, Brodeur 25.)

  ---

  However, once these various homes and meeting halls were completed, the Aesir realized that they were relatively susceptible to attack. Fortuitously (or so it seemed at the time), a giant stopped by and offered to construct them an impregnable wall and a gate to protect their fledgling realm. However, his terms were quite steep, as he wished to receive in payment the hand of Freya in marriage, as well as the sun and the moon. The Aesir agreed to this bargain, on the condition that the work be completed within six months, and that he do it with no help (as they assumed that such a task would simply be impossible to complete). The giant stone-wright agreed to this once Loki convinced the Aesir to allow him to use his stallion to help in the building process.

</BookCitation>

This cosmology of heavenly kingdom, material realm, and of Underworld with the Blinding Abyss seem to match here the general basics of norse mythology - Asgard as home of the Aesir and Vanir clans, Midgard being the realm of mortals, and frozen over underworld known as Niflheim.

#### Stone Constructs

Stone [gun and rocket puppies](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_puppies) were invented by tortomega, resembling drakes, set to guard the halls of the castles. Gun and Rocket Puppies' exterior was made of stone with mechanical internals, as seen by the cracked shells of tier 1 turrets.

They had same design of dragons present in titans' castles, these designs would be later enhanced by gremlins with gun puppies of tiers 2 and 3, explicitly elemental, with the addition of elemental essences contained near spiral imagery carved into a stone slabs on top of gun puppies' heads ([Red Rover](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_Puppy#Red_Rover), [Slush Puppy](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_Puppy#Slush_Puppy), [Sick Puppy](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_Puppy#Sick_Puppy), [Sparky](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_Puppy#Sparky)). The elemental essences in question are 5 star materials of icon like the [Storm Chaser](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Chaser).

Gun puppies of tier 2 and 3 have more mechanical design, with the base at which the rotation of the turret happens, having bolts. Tier 1 gun puppies don't have any external mechanical elements, looking practically the same as the statues at [Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gloaming_Wildwoods), [Aurora Isles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aurora_Isles) and [Haven](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Town_Square).

Reskins resembling [gun puppy](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon_(Gun_Pup)>) for Drakon battle sprite has more advanced design, as has exposed gun barrel present at the back, but also visible wires handing from where the mounting base should be. At the same time, Roarmulus twins or Project R, have artillery mounted on top of turrets.

Gloaming Wildwoods and [Scarlet Fortress](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scarlet_Fortress/Cravat_Hall), apart from the haunted Owlite Keep, have gun puppies which may point to their presence already at that time as the first sentient constructs. If,taken in account previous discussion regarding [origin of castles](#castles), presence of those constructs there can be attributed to a deeper relation of titans and valkyries, and heavenly kingdom as a whole, possibly to a times before supposedly titans stormed the gates of heavenly kingdom, as the technology, if it is diegetic, is present all of those locations.

Weather tortodrones were present during that time - is unknown as no signs of Underworld influence were present in these castles, apart from suggested [tortomega busts within the halls](#fiendish-statues), as the tortodrones were designed with the [evil eye symbol on their shells](#evil-eye) and connected to devilites even during the time when Skylark crash-landed to Cradle.

##### Lumbers as Constructs

On that note of constructs, [Lumbers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lumber) were likely gremlin invention, as they are more crude constructs, have evil eye seal placed on them instead of carefully carved, compared to tortodrone shells.

The lack of void/swarm gun puppies, but lumbers, may also point to them being of different nature, with lumbers being native to material realm and partially natural entities (as tree trunk used as their carcass).

A note, void gun puppies, while present in the game files, are not considered canon, as their design is of an older iteration.

#### Howlitzers, Dragons, and Drakes

Then, there are [howlitzers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Howlitzer) present within regions mostly populated by the undead, and notably Owlite Keep, they have reptilian anatomy, and jaws similar to [fiendish statues](#fiendish-statues), 2 horns at the back of their skulls, depending on their tier, like [drakon battle sprites](#dragons). Those similarities make them seem as drakes or potentially dragons.

Due to [creation myth](#creation-myth), we would consider the original dragons being far larger than a howlitzer, in order for creation myth to be founded, in a general understanding when comparing dragons to any other species.

And yet, this concept seem to fail, as most of evidence on the identity of dragons suggests they were lesser in scale.

As a logical leap, the design of [Drake Scale Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Shield) is the only one having its left side sharpened, while its upgrades have more rounded corners, but more visible scales, more reminiscent of spikes along the back. Similar design pattern - a lack of spikes, - is seen in the [Drake Scale Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Helm), and due to this, we may consider general interpretation of drakes compared to that of dragons, as for them equipment such as [Dragon Scale Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale_Helm) exists.

If considered that _drakes or dragons had to be undead in order for howlitzers to appear_, then gun puppies would have to be invented later, unless they are meant to represent a symbolic dragon, rather than an anatomically correct one, inspired by statues, rather than living beings.

Dragons on their death should have affected the environment within current theory, but at the same time, howlitzers are considered undead and found all across Cradle, same as spookats, _meaning that something had to bring them back at such scale_. The only powers known to be related to undeath, and cause undeath, as it will be later seen, and be related to afterlife, are devilites of Undercorp and powers of curse, the Core, and Kataclysm. Those will be analyzed accordingly.

The prior, considering further relation of tortomega with the Underworld in the [Arrival of Undercorp section](#chapter-vi-arrival-of-undercorp) could be a potential reason for resurrections of dragons, but this idea, as we will further see, would not be developed apart from presence of howlitzers in the Gloaming Wildwoods.

Lastly, howlitzers have a nose horn, which is not seen across dragons, apart from _a specific Drakon evolution_, if we take existing dragon designs.

If we consider chromalisks being descendants of drakes, then drakes would be in between dragon anatomy and chromalisks', and among them one particular specie is of greater interest to us - salamanders. Only [salamander](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chromalisk#Salamander) and [later salamander mask's alchemy tree](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Salamander_Mask) have _a distinct nose spike_. This seems as a more solid link to identifying howlitzers as drakes. Drakon evolution in that context would seem as attribution to drakes whom dragons could've encompassed in their diversity.

Another case could be a further development of Drakon anatomy, as one embodying the totality of dragon anatomy and history, as [Seraphynx](#seraphynx) [represent many different families of kats of Kat Tribe based on their fur color and pattern](#siege-of-the-academy).

So far, most of evidence suggest that howlitzers are drakes, as drakes have a benefit of being less known of across the setting and being related to currently present chromalisks through mythological interpretation of salamanders as modern-day descendants of dragons.

Within howlitzer ribcage a pulsing essence is present similar to essence orbs found on [Gun Puppies](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_puppies). All of howlitzers deal shadow damage, as an undead. Gun puppies of elements do have similar elemental core located on top, reminiscent of the nose horn of salamanders.

If we commit to the idea of valkyries slaying dragons, then it would not be far fetched for drakes falling to them too, resulting in the presence of their remains, brought back to life within the territory of heavenly kingdom and beyond. The question, then, is of how terrestrial drakes managed to reach heavenly kingdom, including the Owlite Academy.

### _Chapter `V`_ Spiral Order

Spiral Order supposedly originates from a planet known as Isora. Although Isora is not confirmed to be the Knights' species homeworld, its presence far enough in the past given items' context, makes us reconsider it as, indeed, the homeworld. Such items being, for example, [Galactic Guardian Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Galactic_Guardian_Helm): `A commemorative helm that pays tribute to the countless brave Isorian guardians that have protected spacefaring crews in their adventures across the stars` or `A special saber used to resemble Isoran spacefarers of old as they sliced across the night sky` ([Celestial Saber](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Saber)). This civilization if framed as one rather ancient and already capable of long-distance travel.

The distinction between `Isoran` and `Isoran` must be made here. While from the spelling perspective both variants can be utilized, we believe that `Isorans` follows the pattern, seen in case of `Almire` / `Almirian`, where the name of the planet or a organizational body ends on a vowel, the suffix is altered by adding "-ian" ending to indicate affiliation. Here, `Isorans` can be used as a shortened form of the prior, depending on speaker's context and formality.

But, one particularity had us to change the proposed terminology, and that is the actual descriptions of aquired items, rather than the official wiki. There, the descriptions, which were containing `Isoran` with an "i", were absent. Instead, all references to Spiral Order as a species are `Isoran`.

As for this document, we will refer to the civilization from planet Isora as Isorans.

Isorans had existed prior to the establishment of a modern Spiral Order, as there are references to a time `eons` before Skylark crash-landed on Cradle: `This suit was once worn by Isoran starfarers of eons long passed that stood watch over extrasolar operations` ([Stellar Sentinel Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stellar_Sentinel_Suit)). Furthermore, this military power structure is not referred explicitly as the Spiral Order, suggesting that Spiral Order is a relatively recent development, perpetuated by, for example, internal conflict:

- `Whether its crest is a relic from the Order of old or a creation from the Knights' time on Cradle is not immediately clear` ([Aegis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis)) - Aegis's description can be interpreted in many ways, but we will start from such as this one, in reference to Spiral Order.
- `A special saber used to resemble Isoran spacefarers of old as they sliced across the night sky` ([Celestial Saber](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Saber)) - existence of a saber suggests a potential inspirations behind Isoran past military tradition which can be mapped onto real-world history.

_Conventionally, eon is greater than a thousand of years, a millennium, usually reaching up to millions of years._ This concept of an organization preceding Spiral Order of Isorans will be kept in mind until further development, and we will look at it in relation to other ancient civilizations. Further analysis will make its major goal to establish a relation and a timescale at which we could place modern Spiral Order and, if a possibility will present itself, their prior history through currently known means and arguments. We consider it important as one of more heated debates regarding Isorans is the question of their presence and involvement in Cradle's history.

#### Symbolism and Dragons

Further establishment of a precise time period when Isorans became a spacefaring race, is unknown. Despite this, a few hints are in fact present.

The [Azure Guardian Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Helm) description, apart from the shared guardian motif, states: `the technique which weaves dragon scale seamlessly into the metal is a closely guarded secret`. This was previously discussed in the [fiendish statues section](#fiendish-statues), and now it will be addressed in relation to Isorans and development of the Order as well as a general overview of their history.

Spiral Order awareness of dragons suggests at least 2 scenarios:

1. Spiral Order was established on the same planet, that was inhabited by dragons. That planet had to be later incorporated into Cradle, as heavenly kingdom and tortomega civilizations are implied to be there, as discussed in the [Ancient Titans section](#chapter-iii-ancient-titans).

   As [Raiders](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raiders_Prize_Box) exist, and they bear same Spiral Order insignia of a spiral warden, on, for example, [Raider Buckler](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raider_Buckler) or the symbol on hte prize box itself, as well shoulder pads' design similar to one of Almirian Crusaders, this marks raiders as potentially related and present in adjacent period of time as the kingdom of Almire. So far we have only designs, but, we will keep this ide in mind.

   Almire lacks warden insignia, but is present on Cradle. Yet, Cradle had remained undiscovered by modern Spiral Order and it does not have any technology explicitly related to Spiral Order or Isorans as a species, apart from a singular case which will be covered later - of a space vessel found in the [Ghost in the machine](#ghosts-in-the-machine) danger mission.

   The technology found on Cradle, including Clockworks, is not recognized by the Skylark crew, nor Almire or the derelict space vessel, a completely alien to Isorans.

   Considering that many worlds are implied to be harvested by the Core in order to build Cradle, the Clockworks themselves could potentially incorporate into themselves Isoran technology as Cradle was constructed. As, so far, it is a thematically inconsistent speculation, we will only keep it in mind for a scenario when those motifs may de affirmed by more evidence of thematic similarities.

   Moreover, Cradle itself does not have any explicit relation to Isorans apart from ever-present imagery of a spiral, one also adopted by gremlins, as they build and deconstruct Clockwork tunnels. Then there are strangers, whose town of Haven does have the same spiral imagery, even if it is build upon Clockwork tunnels, as will be covered in-depth in [Strangers section](#strangers-and-haven).

   From those elements we can gather, as we see, only an omnipresent concept of a spiral, and unknown chronological placement of Raiders, yet somehow related to Spiral Order. We will cover raiders in detail through the course of multiple iterations.

2. As we earlier suggested, Dragons have an ability to travel across disconnected locations and traverse through realm, given their nature as the oldest known creatures apart from inhabitants of Apocrean Realm.

   Under current framework this explanation is based on otherworldliness of dragons, recognized by the Spiral Order, as specified in [dragon scale](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale): `It reflects light with an otherworldly sheen`, as well as through the foundation of previous chapters.

   If items' and materials' descriptions are written by Spiral Order researchers, then this presents an fascinating wording of dragon nature. This is highly likely, considering that the author - a _biotech likely, - does not have full or precise knowledge for entries of items or materials_, that were developed or found on Cradle, which, of course, leaves space for speculation and filling in the blanks.

   At [Revelation in Flames - Sunset_Steppes](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Revelation_in_Flames/Sunset_Steppes) Rhedon mentions that [drakon battle sprites](#dragons) do in fact look similar to dragons: `They seem friendly. In fact they seem to behave just like the battle sprites I know. Only difference is they, uh, well, look like dragons`. This suggests that members of Spiral Order did know, prior to crash landing to Cradle, how dragons had looked in their general appearance to be recognizable. Weather those dragons were extinct on Isora, or a remains of the impression formed by homeworld culture, is a different question, which we will eventually discuss.

Now, there are other signs suggesting, that Spiral Order and dragons might exist near or even in the same period of time, as this temporal proximity is required for Isorans to visually identify those creatures as dragons.

- Spiral Order utilizes dragon scales in alchemy of [Azure Guardian Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Helm): `The technique which weaves dragon scale seamlessly into the metal is a closely guarded secret`.

  Azure armor is of Spiral Order advancement, is the final upgrade of Cobalt Armor and [Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cobalt_Helm), - `a high-performance helmet of the Spiral Order suitable for any adventure`, - that is confirmed to be of Spiral Order, same as [Defender](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Defender): `A durable, high quality shield of the Spiral order that is suitable for any adventure`, then dragons might have been encountered and potentially hunted for scales.

  Unidentified remains nature of those encounters and final fate of dragons. As [Azure Guardian Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Armor) is described as `a grand set of armor commonly donned by the leaders of the Spiral Order`, considering greater rarity items required for better gear, Spiral Order can be analyzed through a lens of inspirations used to create current theme of Spiral Order, that is, military traditions and implied culture.

- [Gold and Iron Dragons](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Armor) - those are types of military units, later merged with Reckon Rangers.

  They specialized in high-profile Morai targets, likely during or before Morai wars. First of, this means that Spiral Order had taken dragons, either from myths, or by observing their living instances, for a naming scheme in their military structure.

  This pattern is usually utilized to symbolize specific characteristics of said animals.

- [Dragon Scale Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale_Mail) calls dragons `creatures of legend`, as if they were in fact extinct, being preserved in language, perception, image, and idea only in legends.

  This idea stands in opposition to one presented in the description of [dragon scales](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale): `An armored scale from what was thought to be an extinct creature`, that dragons had to be hunted in order for their scales to be harvested.

Based on, mainly, description of Drakons by [Rhedon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Revelation_in_Flames/Sunset_Steppes): `In fact they seem to behave just like the battle sprites I know. Only difference is they, uh, well, look like dragons`, the wording suggests that the appearances of dragons is commonly known, again, _either through cultural representation or direct encounter_.

#### Spiral Order and Dragons

And yet, examples above demonstrate, that neither of them could lead to a distinct status of dragons nor explicitly lead to any direct conclusion, as if those instances were spread across a large period of time.

Now, considering prior point, dragon scales are used in military, that might not particularly lead to dragons being hunted, as the same scales are found when going through Clockworks' beast-themes depths. Yet no dragons were encountered there. This allows us to interpret the fact dragons thought to be an extinct ([dragon scales](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale)), in 2 ways:

1. Spiral Order believes that dragons _are extinct_, that the fact dragon scales are found in clockworks, means that they did inhabit Clockworks up until the time Skylark crashed, meaning that there is a population of dragons yet to be found, as scales had to appear from somewhere.

   It is important to note, that the method dragon scales are found - as a drop from enemies found in their according stratums and regions. It is a gameplay mechanic, one that remains vague in its diegetic accuracy.

   If the material drops are diegetic, then this would mean, that dragon scales are consumed or somehow collected and spread across Cradle by wildlife. _Dragon scales may be that widespread, if a particular event would be at a cause, such a mass extinction_, returning to our idea of _dragons being hunted prior to Cradle by heavenly kingdom_.

   We must be kept in sight as a 5 star material, a rare material, found at lower Clockworks' depths from beasts specifically, or potentially alchemized from [Primal Sparks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens): `A small wisp of the essential spirit of nature. It is of extreme value to the Spiral Order`, implying some sort of connection. The presence of the sparks we will keep in mind, as well as their in-game application, symbolism, and utilitarian application.

   Moreover, even if dragons are extinct on Cradle, their scales remain, marking Cradle or one of its composing planets as a plausible habitat for dragons. Then, another question is posed - from what part of Cradle did dragons originate as a specie, or where did they come from?

2. Spiral Order believes that dragons _are not extinct_ through the similarity of drakon battle sprites to dragons.

This seems as a less likely explanation, but a plausible one, if we contextualize:

- Battle sprites resembling dragons to a point that they had to be named like dragons
- The scales are used in military, of high ranking armors. Considering the ongoing war with Morai, source of such material would be at least a strategic value, if it indeed offers great defense.

From those suggestions, considering both presence of dragon scales on Cradle, the fact that dragons were with a high chance considered extinct on Isora when ever Skylark was launched, and perception of some creature as dragons through descriptions and dialogue, large accent on the legend of dragons, we lean to a conclusion, that _dragons were extinct due to Spiral Order harvesting their scales_.

This can be also affirmed by drawing parallels between Spiral Order and real world top-ranking units of military structures:

- The Chinese emperors often used sable fur in their robes, which led to the near-extinction of the sable species in some regions ([Long-term archives reveal shifting extinction selectivity in China's postglacial mammal fauna](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2017.1979))
- European royalty and nobility frequently used stoat fur for their ceremonial robes. The demand for this fur led to significant declines in the populations of stoats.
- Japanese Samurai Armor. High-ranking samurai sometimes used tortoise shells and ivory in their armor and accessories. The demand for these materials led to the decline of certain turtle and elephant populations.

Then there is an animal-themed naming conventions across internal structure of the Spiral Order, preceding Recon Rangers. This is one instance seems more direct in comparison to the rest, as an inspiration from real-world military tradition, unit, and division naming conventions.

Among them, Viking are of greater interest to us due to presence of Raiders - those warriors often used animal names and symbols, such as Berserkers, associated with a state of trance and fury. This is also reminiscent of the rage motif as alone of primordial elements. While the general relation may not lead, currently, to any direct conclusion, what seems more plausible in this context, is the potential _celtic origins of the Spiral as an omnipresent symbol, integrated into past Isoran culture_. We will return to the concept of a spiral later in the analysis.

Spiral Order armors and uniforms resemble cultural image of medieval, mainly central european armor prior to Renaissance, apart from more distinctly modern instances, such as [padded armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Padded_Armor). This allows for some room for medieval Europe military being used as an inspiration for Spiral Order, as one of directions to search through.

The definition or medieval is important here, for clarity, 10th to 16th century Europe is used as a reference point. [Azure Guardian Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Helm) looks similar to bascinet hounskull which dates to 14th century Europe. Based on this context of potential inspirations behind Spiral Order design we suggest that dragons were indeed hunted.

#### Utilitarian Alchemy

There is not a lot information about Spiral Order history in relation to alchemy. At that, [Mighty Cobalt Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mighty_Cobalt_Armor) is stated to be `An advanced set of Spiral Knight armor skillfully crafted using the most recently deciphered Clockworks technology` ([Mighty Cobalt Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mighty_Cobalt_Armor)). By preceding Azure Guardian armor, Azure Guardian armor itself then might be considered as one originating from Cradle, paralleling in than notion [Aegis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis): `Whether its crest is a relic from the Order of old or a creation from the Knights' time on Cradle is not immediately clear.`

Considering that Azure armor is granted to most valuable members of the Spiral Order, we suggest it existing at least before Skylark had crash-landed on Cradle, - that the alchemy path prior to it is exactly this - _an alchemy, which transmutes given materials through a vague, as vague as medieval alchemy itself, recipes, into a desired results_. This idea, we propose, is at the the root of the theme of alchemy being utility-oriented, rather than its real-world counterpart, being a reflection of subjective context onto the external objective. Here, it is achieved through recipes, which in the context of a spacefaring civilization (`A special suit of armor designed specifically for knights on first recon of alien planets. This rugged suit protects against a variety of harsh elements` - [Tri-Guard Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tri-Guard_Armor)) would be invaluable, as they, by that logic, allow for creation of equipment without preestablished, highly technological base of an `alien planet`.

To go with this concept of utility-first alchemy further, - this approach allows for manufacture of highly advanced gear in an area which is not well covered or adapted by Isorans, - that being Cradle. Due to this, due to the knowledge of energy, of alchemy, of a preexisting hierarchy within Spiral Order, those factors seems to suggest, that most of the equipment themes, - not the equipment itself, apart from carriers of the core themes, such as Azure Guardian Armor, - are native to Isora, and only though alchemy those are adapted by application of materials, found on an alien planet.

Due to convenience of alchemy within this explanation would justify mainly symbolic relation of materials and resulting equipment - as alchemy, by its real-world-inspired origins and as a diegetic mechanic, would allow for such interpretation to be valid from the perspective of the source material.

If alchemy belongs to Isorans - who had introduces it on Cradle? Who build the [alchemy stations](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alchemy_Station), apart from regular ones we also search for a valid explanation on [Mysterious Alchemy Machine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mysterious_Alchemy_Machine) and [Sanctuary Alchemy Machine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sanctuary_Alchemy_Machine), while having a seemingly universal symbol of either alchemy or an [Orb of Alchemy](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Orb_of_Alchemy#Orb_of_Alchemy). The latter is identified by 2 characteristic golden curved frames positioned around a central orb. We will keep this question in mind.

Alchemy-based approach also puts the description of [Aegis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis) under same question of placement in chronology: `Whether its crest is a relic from the Order of old or a creation from the Knights' time on Cradle is not immediately clear`, - which equipment was invented by Spiral Order on Cradle and what was already present on Cradle prior to Skylark crash landing? Some items may not be related as per regular crafting. Such case was presented with [Drake Scale Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Shield) alchemy paths' tree, whose elements are not places chronologically as they are presented on the tree itself. Those items are separated temporally and historically, which is, again, not represented in the alchemy tree itself.

Finally, the process of crafting that gear is called alchemy explicitly, not crafting although it is implied so. Alchemy, in that context will be examined after the analysis of the Clockworks.

##### Technology, Alchemy, and Isoran Redesigns

Shield are known to have energy source, which allows for bubble-like force field to be created as a primary protection measure (`A sturdy Defender upgraded with its own internal energy source for more effective protection` - [Great Defender](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Great_Defender)).

Most of shields have [Energy](#energy) symbol present, which we will [discuss in relation to Mist Energy collectors later]():

- [Aegis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis) and its alchemy path.
- [Ancient Plate Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Shield)
- [Darkfang Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Darkfang_Shield)
- [Royal Jelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Shield) and its alchemy path.
- [Drake Scale Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Shield), but its alchemy path lacks a direct representation of an energy symbol, remaining as a colored light dot.

For to be present on directly different civilizations, such as Jellies, potentially dragons or drakes, and ancient plates, we suggest that those are modified with Spiral Order technology. Apart from the gremlin Darkfang shield, which will be discussed within the context of gremlin civilization, _similar underlying logic_ may be applied, as discussed in [introduction of energy](#energy), to armors, as in case of [Ironmight Plate Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironmight_Plate_Mail) and its alchemy path, - characterized by the symbol of energy, located below neck on the armor's backplate.

It seems likely that, while inconsistent, __notion of Isoran technology being integrated into alchemized gear__, is one that allows for items from different periods and epochs to be brought into reality while remaining or even amplifying its efficiency through modern technology.

The case of such items being adapted can be seem most clearly for the [Crest of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crest_of_Almire). The entities aligning themselves with the kingdom of Almire - [Almirian Shadow Guard](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_Shadow_Guard#Almirian_Shadow_Guard), [Carnavons](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Carnavon#Carnavon), [Almirian Crusaders](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_Crusader), and [Citadel wheel launchers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wheel_Launcher) - have a different shape of the crest.

The shape of transmuted [Crest of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crest_of_Almire) is the same as the [Aegis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis), a shield made by the Spiral Order. But the entities above use [Blackened Crest](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blackened_Crest) design and shape, alas larger.

It is here [the restored Almirian Tapestry has angelic wings below the crown](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almire_Furniture#Doodads) at the roots of the black tree. This seems as a solid enough evidence for us to consider Spiral Order's _notion of adapting preexisting designs and technology_ through alchemy into reality, rather than unreasonable but consistent design alteration.

Yet, we can not explain the design choice itself, as the tree roots and angel wings symbolism is not something common, unless we are to refer what [Nature Sprite said in the Overgrown Court](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Overgrown_Court): `Yes, we nature sprites are the rain, the root, and the soil. But you are not like us. You are like the ones below. ... Good fortune, star-borne`, - we can attempt to link heavens, due to wings, to stars, as for Nature Sprites it could be essentially the same, as we will discuss later in the context of [the kingdom of Almire and its relation to Nature Sprites and greater Spirit Mother](#almire-and-spirit-mother).

As it was stated that `Spiral Order has relied on alchemy as their primary means of creating the very arsenals that Knights have relied upon for centuries` ([Alchemy for Beginners](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alchemy_for_Beginners)), we previously proposed, that the convention of energy was as old as practice of alchemy, we can attempt to link alchemy of Spiral Order, accompanied by the concept of energy to real-world alchemy.

We propose, that the candidate and inspiration to energy symbol may be a concept of salt in alchemy up to its symbol "üúî" and extended usage. The inverted energy symbol is similar to another symbol - saltpetre "üúï", a key component to gunpowder, which seem to be fitting to overall medieval-like inspiration of Spiral Order designs, and to be one used on military turrets. Apart from it, it can represent a lack of energy, symbolized by a darker red color, relating to the same color of energy counter once it reaches 0.

Lastly, in terms of adapted for Spiral Order redesigns, there is tortodrone equipment. As much as this equipment is reminisnect of concrete elements of a tortodrone, it is significantly different: the shell becomes a shield, while tortodrone's fist becomes a mountable gauntlet. This pattern emerges when we look at [Omegashell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Shell) and [Omegaward](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omegaward), the prior of which we have attributed to tortomega, and the latter to tortodrone - here, we believe, the naming convention, and the context of application seem to be particularly consistent in relation to a species which were taken for inspiration for the equipment in question.

In this regard, while we have attibuted [Ancient Plate Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Armor) to tortomega, the established above design pattern does not seemingly apply here, even if we take in consideration [Omegashell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Shell) as one of tortomega species, while there is an [Ancient Plate Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Shield). This discrepancy, as a matter of this proposal, remains unresolved.

Despite this, we will point out a few elements of this series of armors, specifically, apart from the energy symbol on the back, there is a glowing circle at armor's belt which seem to serve unknown purpose, and present only on modern variants of the armor - the alchemy path of [Ironmight Plate Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironmight_Plate_Mail), absent for [anciant](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Mail) and [Volcanic Plate Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Mail), which might point to this element being another Spiral Order technology. Notably, it is in the description of 3-star [Boosted Plate Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Boosted_Plate_Mail): `A suit of Spiral Plate Mail with a supercharged internal power source. The upgrade didn't make the armor any lighter`, which makes us think of this element as the power source. The fact the armor is called boosted, in the context of the supercharge might point to this power source existing and for 2-star variant, the [Spiral Plate Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spiral_Plate_Mail). We will keep this design choice in mind until the later discussion reagarding [mist energy tanks within knights' armor]().

#### Auras and Souls

Isorans have auras and, possibly, souls. Auras are mentioned in the [Pembrooke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke#Dialogue) dialogue during [Kataclysmic Confrontation](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kataclysmic_Confrontation): `They carry the heaviest curse of all and mindlessly seek to devour magical auras. This constant consuming of power makes them incredibly strong`.

Cradle has property of making spirits return to material realm (`Why spirits return to the material realm is unknown, trough it is clear that many of the spirits within the Clockworks have come from other worlds` - [Weight of Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness)). The [souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul) are observed for the first time at [Blades of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blades_of_the_Fallen) and later in a few other places:

- [Static souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Static_Soul) in the Dry Docks of [Ghost in the Machine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghosts_in_the_Machine).
- Discovered [Frozen souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Frozen_Soul) near Amu-Sol in [Heart of Ice](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice). They are confirmed to come from underworld as Everfrost had contained them, with Everfrost tower being demolished by Maulos (`The intel we've collected so far suggests that fiends utilize large deposits of the stuff to trap the souls of the lost within it, like some kind of icy prison. It would seem that Maulos, that horrible arch-fiend you just took down, had a different use in mind and was actually destroying this everfrost to unleash ... souls into the Clockworks` - [Recon Ranger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Everfrost_Tower), `A 'towering pillar' of everfrost and 'all the frozen souls it brings forth'` - [Fiendish Memo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Amu-Sol)).
- Later released [Fire souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Fire_Soul) in Firestorm Citadel of [Shadowplay](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay).
- Relating both to the Swarm and to the Void, [Void Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Void_Soul) are found in the Whitespace of the Core during the events of [Dreams and Nightmares](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares). So far Void remains unknown.

The souls, being both related to Underworld and Apocrea, presence of [freed souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Freed_Soul), must be kept in mind. Entrapment of souls by Apocrea is described in the following manner: `Only souls keep these engines roaring, heard screaming across distant stars. Only souls can fill their void, sublime in its vast emptiness` ([Allister Danford - journal entry](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)).

Auras, on the other hand, are mentioned only once by [Pembrooke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke), while describing [Black Kats](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat#Black_Kat): `They carry the heaviest curse of all and mindlessly seek to devour magical auras. This constant consuming of power makes them incredibly strong. They were likely attracted to the power radiating from the ancient grimoires here in the Archives`.

Based on those descriptions it can concluded that both auras and souls are implied to be contain power.

This flow of power, possibly related to the concept of [Energy](#energy) can physically change one consuming it, as Black Kats. While Black Kats are seen directly and suggested to relate to auras, this cannot be said about Apocrean Engines. What really stands for those engines is unknown, but, as stated by [Lost Souls within Obsidian Nexus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Obsidian_Nexus), `The Apocrea are stuff of nightmares: a terrible legion of otherworldly phantasms whose only ambition seems to be trapping and devouring the souls of all life`, - souls are a way of sustenance for entities of Apocrean Realm, and a fuel for the engines, that is including a quote by Danford: `Within cities where geometry and madness share meaning, constructed from thought, from unnatural impulse, the Apocrea dream dark machines into being. Only souls keep these engines roaring, heard screaming across distant stars. Only souls can fill their void, sublime in its vast emptiness` ([Allister Danford - journal entry](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)). There is still a notion of: `harvesting ... souls for some unimaginable purpose` ([Obsidian Nexus - Lost Soul](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Obsidian_Nexus)).

This may mean that souls and auras are similar if not the same metaphysical elements present within Isorans or any life in general, at that point. But then [Pembrooke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke) explicitly mentions auras, when souls are seem to be referred as souls by the majority, without naming them differently, this may lead to a potentially different nature of auras compared to souls, unless auras are souls in the understanding of Spookats - the Kat Tribe, - which was related to Owlites and their research.

While souls were seen in the form of [Lost](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul), [freed](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Freed_Soul), [skull-wearing](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_(Skull)>) as [Phantoms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Phantom), and [Almirian Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire), _auras were not_. When thinking of auras, the first thing is the accessories, but they does not seem to be identical to implied metaphysical auras.

##### Initial Analysis of Auras

In the Moorcroft Manor, and in Haven, [Pembrooke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke#Dialogue) states: `black kats came out of some dark portal deep within the Clockworks and have raided the Moorcroft Archives! ... They carry the heaviest curse of all and mindlessly seek to devour magical auras. This constant consuming of power makes them incredibly strong. They were likely attracted to the power radiating from the ancient grimoires here in the Archives`.

As Black Kats are found in the library-like rooms, it is highly likely that those archived indeed have the same similar power as auras. And a few of those books were seen to have magical properties - ones found and placed on the [stands](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mystical_Tome_Stand#Stands) in the [Moorcroft Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Moorcroft_Prize_Box): [Cursed, Mystical and Ancient stands](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cursed_Tome_Stand#Stands).

While cursed tome is affected by the curse, having similar manifestations of curse seen across many instances, and ancient tome remains the same, the [mystical tome](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mystical_Tome_Stand#Mystical_Tome_Stand) is one of the most interest to us: `a magical tome filled with arcane symbols, esoteric formulae, and a few particularly rude doodles`.

As this tome is one associated with the Moorcroft Archives, we suggest, that it is a representation of a power, existing as the basis for auras. The nature-like motif of this implied aura will be deeper analyzed with the acquired context of [Nature Sprites](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nature_Sprite) mainly due to similarity of those magics. Nature Sprites are connected to Almire, so the kingdom will be also covered later in its own [chapter](#chapter-vii-kingdom-of-almire). This idea will be further developed in the context of [Kat Tribe and Owlites analysis]().

This distinction can also be searched for across real world inspirations.

In various cultures and spiritual traditions, the concepts of the soul and aura are often viewed as distinct metaphysical entities, each with its own characteristics and significance. This distinction is reminiscent of a different inspiration.

In Buddhism, the term "atman" refers to the "subtle body" of an individual. This "soul" is eternal and transcends physical existence, as capable of existing beyond it.

And yet, it is subtle, its presence is felt through flowing though and around it omnipresent energy, life force, the prana. This _identified concept of a circulating life force, which is also ever-present as the aura_, that surrounds the body and represents its inner state. While the _atman is considered the true, subtle self, the prana is seen as a manifestation of one's state of being, its presence_.

It can be linked to the `radiating power` of the tomes, described by [Pembrooke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke#Dialogue): `They were likely attracted to the power radiating from the ancient grimoires here in the Archives`. And it is also here, Lost Souls, even when their elemental alignment is acknowledged, are present as series of abstract shapes, to some degree [reminiscent of Whitespace itself](#symbolism-of-whdow-lairs).

To conclude, it is likely that both aura and soul of Isorans are metaphysical components, both interaction with realms beyond the material realm, but only souls has sentience after death of a body, capable of interacting with Underworld's physics and both are sought after by Apocrea and Black Kats, in _all instances as a potential power source_.

Yet we can't currently conclude of them being the same concept until we do the analysis of the [Kataclysm](#kataclysm), [kingdom of Almire](#kingdom-of-almire), and [Owlites](#kat-tribe).

##### Corporeal Body

As we have previously mentioned on Isorans being similar to people of Almire, through the course of this theory we cover arguments and evidence for and against the idea of kingdom of Almire being the same species as Isorans.

To continues this notion, we should note of the remaining ghostly representations of Almirians seem to look same as Spiral Knights, prime example being [Torin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torin) and [Lord Vanaduke's face](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lord_Vanaduke) without his mask.

As [graveyards](#graveyards) were [discussed](#castles), we suggested that large coffins belong to people of Almire. Same coffins are located within the castles presumably belonging to valkyries, which had linked both parties, but now with an unidentified cultural similarity.

Yet, that does not explicitly mean that valkyries and Isorans are the same specie, - while the armor and overall themes of heaven and celestials are seem to match, [the prior will be related to Owlites though the course of the analysis](#heavenly-kingdom-and-owlites), a different species.

Isorans are aware of concept of graveyards and do utilize it in their own culture, as seen in [Blades of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blades_of_the_Fallen), this being evident by the ceremonial tradition of Reverse Arms. Yet, Spiral Order and Isorans seem to be not aware of Underworld and other damage types - elemental and shadow.

As discussed in [crypts section](#crypts), presence of zombies as well as an entire roster of legion of Almire suggests, they seem to have a corporeal body with a skeletal structure.

As the main bridging element for Almire and Isorans similarity consists of the depictions and appearances of Lost Souls of Almire looking as Isorans, there exists a possibility of this similarity to be as simply explained as a design choice, restricted by game's scope, not requiring to model a significantly different design for Almirians. But, as the analysis takes all of the content at face value, we will continue with this notion onwards, noting, such as now, with current designs in mind.

At the same time, as Lost Souls are usually encountered as hostile entities of abstract translucent orbs, we can wonder weather Almirians were capable of presenting themselves as Isoran look-a-likes, or are as such. It is known that the fact of a Lost Souls being not aggressive does not lead to it being seen as somebody else - as in case of [Lost Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul) within the Obsidian Nexus and in Haven, - they remain the same.

There is also an instance of Lost Souls possessing a [skull](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_(Skull)>), those are seen in both Firestorm Citadel and Moorcroft Manor, suggesting that Lost Souls of Almire are the way they are depicted for a reason.

There are also [phantoms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Phantoms), which are undead capable of inflicting curse, and have the same characteristic skull with a turbulent glow. When phantom is defeated, it retreats to its more simplistic form of an ember-like entity.

Here, we must note of Lord Vanaduke's mask being of the similar nature, both as a potential lost souls connected with the concept of curse. But, Vanaduke's mask is also stated to be his vulnerability: `Our sensors show the mask is a source of power as well as a potential weakness` ([Monstrous Codex: Lord Vanaduke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vanaduke)). Nature of Lord Vanaduke's curse will be discussed in the according section for the kingdom of Almire. As for the rest of the concept regarding lost souls of Almire, they could be seen as such due to proximity to the Nature Sprites, which are seen to have a method to combat the curse, but currently this notion must be kept in mind until the analysis of kingdom of Almire.

There are [Fire Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Fire_Soul) after Firestorm Citadel began to crumble during events of [Shadowplay](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay).

Lastly, there is existence of [abstracted, regular Lost Souls, which still possess a consciousness](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_(SotA-Haven)>), such as during the events of [Shroud of Apocrea](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea), while persisting in the material realm, albeit surrounded by [resurfacing Apocrean Realm as slabs of obsidian in Havenhttps://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Haven-Event-SotA-TownSquare.png].

We suggest, that the souls are the sentient souls in common understanding - a one's sentiant and eternal being, while the omnipresent energy, - the aura, accompanies it, granting a degree of physicality and persistency in the material realm, be it a spiritual form, as of Almirians, or allowing of presence outside of a physical object. The other case is one being bound to an object, [haunting it]().

To paraphrase, an aura is a carrier or container for a soul - a body, indistingushable, but essential element to existence of both in the material realm. But, the closer is the soul is located to other realms, the necessity in aura as a corporeal body vanishes.

#### Establishment of Order

Over an unidentified period of time Isorans were spreading across the space of material realm (`With this equipped, you can see a clear path across the night sky to countless worlds beyond` - [Celestial Nav Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Nav_Helm)).

We assume, that items of the [Equinox Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Equinox_Prize_Box) describe an era prior to establishment of Spiral Order, as it is not called as such, but rather as Isorans as a whole, in reference to a planet, with an advanced enough technology for interstellar travel. Back at their prime they were capable of plunging into stars: `With this equipped, you feel like you could dive into the heart of a star` ([Stellar Sentinel Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stellar_Sentinel_Suit)), we can conclude that the Isoran civilization had existed for a while, eons, specifically.

There must be a distinction or rather, a point of Spiral Order establishment. The overall roster of those items links Isorans' past to Cradle based solely on the presence of equinox prize box and shared energy symbol, although the designs of equinox items are not like anything seen anywhere else, apart from common elements in equipment itself, shared with the rest of Spiral Order equipment.

Moreover, alchemical motif is also, we believe, present here. Specifically, in the case of the [Celestial Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Shield). Its shape and duality in the description: `Cradle's equinox inspired the dual nature of this specialist shield, which protects against the dazzling light of day and the chill of the night in equal measure`, we believe, points to a depiction of a fifth divine element, present in medieval alchemy - [Azoth](https://www.alchemy-texts.com/assets/img/books/basil-valentine-azoth/VA04.jpg), or, the alchemical First Matter.

<BookCitation source="AZOTH or the way to make the hidden gold of the Philosophers - Brother Basil Valentin">
  {#snippet markup()}

  O most precious & most excellent foundation, from which all things are produced in these lands, though you are at first a venom adorned with the name of Fugitive Eagle. The first matter & the white & red seed of the divine blessing, in the body of which the drought & the rains are closed, which however are hidden from the impious because of the ornament & virginal dress scattered throughout the earth; your father and mother are the sun and the moon, the water and the wine also operate in you, the gold likewise and the silver in the earth, so that mortal man may rejoice therein in this way.

  {/snippet}
</BookCitation>

At some point in time, Spiral Order had to be established. The name of a Spiral, a symbol widespread across Cradle, was utilized in Isoran military. This must be for a reason, as no sny any concept comes that close as the Spiral being that prominent.

The Spiral seemingly holds meaning to Isorans as it is depicted both as ornamen as well as a central element, the latter being, for example, [Swiftstrike Buckler](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Swiftstrike_buckler).

Near or prior to time of Spiral Order creation, spiral wardens are established as a military unit, as their armor's design is taken as Spiral Order symbol, a horse head - [warden](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spiral_Warden). This tradition carried into the future as Spiral Order was established ([Warden Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Warden_Helm)).

We can also suggest that Wardens were inspired by fiendish Legion of Ur as if it was established earlier in the timeline, mainly due to both parties possessing same animalistic characteristics and strength. But, as it will be explored later, we suggest that Legion of Ur had to appear during the fall of Almire and was later sealed by actor of material realm in the [legion of Ur section](#legion-of-ur), specifically, by Valkyries of heavenly kingdom.

Legion of Ur or any fiend and even existence of Underworld itself was not seen by Isorans, despite presence of piercing weaponry. This idea, despite presence of Underworld and spirits being mentioned, is based on an idea that Spiral Order had not encountered nor named Underworld for it to develop specific shadow-resistant defenses, while focusing solely on piercing and normal damage.

##### Concept of Spiral

The exact point as well as the origins of Spiral Order were glimpsed over. It is important to analyze the concept of a Spiral as it is too universal to be looked past.

Currently, it is known, that the Knights incorporated concept of spiral at some point in time through naming conventions and image patterns. This spiral imagery is also widespread on Cradle, notably:

- Cradle's seemingly fractured Moon with definitive spiral on a landscape is present on its surface.

  As the spiral is always visible from any location, during the day when Skylark crash-landed and on replica moons within Clockwork skydomes, it can be concluded with certainty, that the moon is tidally locked, either through an artificial process or as a natural celestial body mechanics of Cradle. The presence of a spiral on its near side seems to be intentional, or may be a consequence of being located near Cradle, but as there are not many instances of natural spiral, - elemental wolvers, sporadically - this seems unlikely.

- Wolvers - [Ash tail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver#Ash_Tail) and [Frostifur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver#Frostifur) subspecies of [wolvers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver) have spiral pattens on their coats. A speculation for only those two wolver species possessing a spiral might be of an unnatural nature of them, a connection to [Underworld](#influences-of-underworld) and Fire Deity. But this proposal seem to fail, as we suggested an existence of a [Underworld cults](#fiendish-cults).
- Construct [Lumbers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lumber) are constructed from a tree with spiral pattern on its bark. Same trees are potentially seen in the [Jigsaw Valley](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jigsaw_Valley). As discussed in the [lumbers section](#lumbers-as-constructs), they are likely gremlins' creation, implying some knowledge of seal magic, as seen in lumbers' elemental variants. This rare usage of shadow-related concepts, and also energy cell present in the [Darkfang Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Darkfang_Shield), will be covered accordingly.
- Clockwork tunnels' floor tiles. The tunnels are build by gremlins, which would mean that gremlins are aware of this concept, as they keep presence of spiral consistent across depths.
- Stone structures within the [Ancient Grove](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Grove).
- Whitespace of the Core has imagery and structures resembling spirals:
  - Walkways' square spiral patterns between level sections
  - Patterns of square spirals present on the gates - enemy gates and golden key gates.
  - Square spiral pattern is also observed within imagery of [Mysterious Consoles and the Artifact](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Artifact).
- Square spiral stonework patterns are seen in Haven.
- [Starlight Cradle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlight_Cradle) and the rest of Aurora Isles have a unique blocks with a glowing during the night spiral carved in them. The glow's color is reminiscent of [valestone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mineral#Valestone), which is used in the [Starlight Hunting Coat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlight_Hunting_Coat).

At that point, the question of who build the Artifact and the Core, while is of separate nature, remains, and eventually will be explored in the [according section](#divine-and-whitespace-clockworks). But, this concept of a spiral must be examined as one extending beyond Cradle which requires understanding Cradle an its history first, in order to draw any conclusions. And, if taking in account knowledge of Spiral Order of dragons, weather or not dragons had originated on Cradle, there must be a solid reason for Isoran military be named with spiral in mind, reaffirming possible connection between Isorans and whatever past they may have with Cradle.

A safe speculation can be performed, one that is based on idea of separate histories of Isorans and Clockworks: assuming that **the Spiral is, at least partially, a universal or interstellar phenomenon, important enough to be replicated in many instances, even cultures and civilizations**, it may be related to other illusive concepts, such as other realm or a deity - a part of a different, omnipotent concept that remains undiscovered. But it remains a speculation as a connection is established purely though to lack of strong leads, but hints of relation. Yet again, the Core, and the design of Whitespace have to be examined later due to complex and interconnected context of Whitespace itself to other less known of concepts, such as the Void or the Swarm.

#### Morai

Now there are Morai and the Morai Wars, which had brought Isorans to the brink of extinction (`The Morai Wars have brought us to the brink of extinction` - [Spiral Knights: Prologue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5CrSNU-Wyg)).

Dragons were likely hunted by Spiral Order, with the reason behind it being the resource of dragon scales. It is valuable enough to be considered a military secret. This also implies that scales have some valuable properties.

What are those properties? All cobalt branch of alchemy does have piercing defenses:

- [Riftlocker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Riftlocker) and [Breach Blaster](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Breach_Blaster) are piercing damage type weapons.
- [Cobalt](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cobalt_Armor) armor and [Defender](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Defender) alchemy trees have piercing defense.

This can lead, based on enemy types present across Clockworks, that Morai, while they could be same as Isorans, were possibly beings, vulnerable to piercing damage, with their machinery also (`These firearms proved instrumental during the siege of Isora in breaking through the war machines of the Morai` - [Riftlocker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Riftlocker)) susceptible to piercing damage, as well as their armor (`An enhanced pierce blaster designed to break through hostile armor` - [Breach Blaster](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Breach_Blaster)).

If items' descriptions are written by the Spiral Order researchers, then, it can be plausible for the [damage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Damage) and [monster classification](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Monster) be also of the same origin.

##### Entity Classification of Morai

There are 2 cases to cover: weather Morai are an Isoran colony and are of the same specie, or, Morai are a different specie, based on their relation to piercing damage classification.

Beasts and fiends are weak to piercing damage, but only beasts and slimes can deal it. Yet there are no constructs nor armors that are vulnerable to piercing - this is a novel concept, as it does not fit to an established damage framework.

There are only a few members of Skylark Crew that are confirmed to fight in Morai Wars:

- [Desna and Reckon Rangers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Desna)
- [Rhendon and Scarlet Scouts](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rhendon)
- [Euclid and Alpha Squad](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Euclid)
- [Captain Ozlo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ozlo)

In relation to the siege of Isora: [Pathfinder Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Padded_Armor) and its alchemy tree have specific strategic roles. From this earlier period of time, armors such as [Circuit Breaker Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Circuit_Breaker_Armor), [Frostbreaker Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frostbreaker_Armor), and [Emberbreak Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Emberbreak_Armor) all refer to an elemental core present within the armor and being hacked (`Armor with a hacked elemental core aimed at resisting fire. However, this non-standard modification creates other elemental weaknesses.` - [Emberbreak Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Emberbreak_Armor)). This suggests that at least _basic understanding of the elements, without introduction to magic of higher rarity materials, was developed_.

Note on slimes. Slimes seem to be unique to Clockworks as then their hierarchy then would not be a novel discovery to the Spiral Order, as suggested by Kora: `Apparently, monsters within the slime family actually have a ruling aristocracy of elite slimes. These 'Royal Jellies' are enormous, selfish and ill-tempered slimes that live in opulent palaces that we can only guess have been squatted in as we do not believe slimes are capable of building structures` ([Another Trace - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Another_Trace)).

Could presence of Riftlocker also mean that the personnel of said war machines was the target, but not the constructs? This is plausible, but currently does not help with the identification.

If Morai are fiends, then this would certainly lead to Spiral Order's discovery of shadow damage and Underworld. While the prior is practically true, awareness of Underworld apart from Cradle is unknown. The only way we can look into Isoran understanding of Underworld is through their response on existence of fiends and lingering spirits on Cradle. Considering many different mentions of Underworld, and specifically mission description of [Whipping and Mishandling](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Whipping_and_Mishandling): `After Recon Knights discovered a fiendish city known as Sol' Fork, Spiral HQ deployed a research team to station itself in the heart of the city and study the devilites within. Their finding have become the basis for our understanding of devilite culture and their motives for working with gremlins`, it seems that Underworld was discovered as it is, a separate realm, only on Cradle.

Lastly, the most likely scenario - Morai are simply Isoran colony, which had not, same as Isorans, encountered any non-material realm entities even with entirety of their technology. As Isorans are a spacefaring civilization, as most directly proven by existence of Skylark, Morai are one of Isoran colonies. As it was stated by celestial sets, that explicitly Isorans were spacefaring, it makes it seem as Isora was the homeworld for this civilization.

Due to those factors, we suggest, that if we ever to place morai into this entity classification table, they would possess similar properties to gremlins - bearing their insignia, as gremlins have their's, and being separate in their damage types and resistances, compared to other enemy types.

#### Isora and Cradle

As Isorans are a spacefaring civilization, we will discuss further several similarities between Cradle and Isorans in attempt to identify the nature of this relation.

##### Spiral Raiders

Across Raiders' equipment, [Raider Buckler](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raider_Buckler) has the same Spiral Order symbol, but seems to be from a different period of time, preceding the celestial items. This can be resolved it 2 ways:

1. Spiral imagery is seen in celestial equipment, suggesting that it was utilized by Isorans from very early times, during the less technological age, one inspired by northern cultures. This similarity to valkyries and heavenly kingdom will be kept in mind.
2. It is not of native Isoran origin. It seem that at least a few other items could support that theory, - [Raiders Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raiders_Prize_Box) has [Firestorm Raider Tunic](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Raider_Tunic#Firestorm_Raider_Tunic): `Treasure is at your fingertips and ash in your wake with this soot laden coat`, [Firestorm Raider Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Raider_Helm#Firestorm_Raider_Helm): `A pristine raider helmet, save for a few dings and a thick coat of ash`, and [Firestorm Skeggox](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Skeggox): `An ornate, fiery axe favored by raiders for its versatility`, - these items of raider roster have fiery/ash themes, and as the name itself suggest, are meant to be associated with the Firestorm Citadel, or, although less likely, [firestorm skill](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm) of [drakon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon), which is also referencing dragons: `Summon the power of true dragon fire to burn everything in your path`.

Note that there is gear of other elements: of frost and squall. Weather those elements are related to original three of dragons - rage, frenzy, storms, - is unlikely, but the pattern itself of naming common elements differently seems to be present also here.

All of these items have spiral imagery: as weapons have spiral carved onto them, and costumes have spiral on their belt and other elements of equipment. Considering that dragons were a possible inspiration both for Spiral Order and Valkyries, with both containing norse mythology motifs, - can they be further connected in attempt to relate valkyries to Isorans as potentially the same species?

Another explanation for those items can be based on the development of Isorans, marking establishment of Spiral Order or its precursor far earlier in their history, with symbol of a spiral already being a staple for its predecessors.

Although it can be fitting, this does seem to align with current themes. Those themes are that of being a greater focus on Cradle and its inhabitants. For example the Equinox, which being on Cradle, but the theme of items relates to Isoran past. At the same time, as Almire will be explored as being a civilization of the same specie as Isorans, there's a very high possibility of different Isoran civilization being present near that time, one that invaded Almire and had witnesses Lord Vanaduke's actions first-hand. _If not for fire-themed items, raiders could very much fit to Isora rather than Cradle_, and this very reason seems to us as a relatively strong argument that there were other Isoran civilizations existing with Almire, of different culture and different location.

Considering that the norse mythology is most prominent here, [Glacial prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Glacial_Prize_Box) items must be examined in that relation. The topic of arctic region is highly important to a possible entities behind Undercorp's plot on Cradle, it is explored in the [nefarious imp and arctic plot section](#nefarious-imp-arctic-plot).

Both scenarios lead to the same question being posed - __how and when Isorans had to arrive to Cradle or one of its planets in order to have both less developed technology, - as raiders and Almire, - but also preserve Spiral Order symbolism - as strictly raiders?__

##### Spacefarers of Old

The terms `spacefarers of old` ([Celestial Nav Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Nav_Helm)) and `Isoran starfarers of old` ([Celestial Nav Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Nav_Suit)) may be linked to [Aegis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis): `Whether its crest is a relic from the Order of old`.

By being referred by the phrase `of old`, and Spiral Order usually being mentioned in gears' description directly, it introduces a level of vagueness to Spiral Order origins.

If Aegis is of the order before Spiral Order, it must bear same emblem as Spiral Wardens, as well as presence of spiral patterns. And if raiders are even more ancient Isorans, then Warden had also to exist. Potentially, in a more medieval iteration.

This is the first explanation. The second explanation, which we have discussed earlier - one relying in the themes of relation to Cradle, of Spiral Order at some point arriving to Cradle in the past and remained there, explaining both raider low-tech gear and similarity of Isorans to citizens of Almire.

The other important point, which we believe, affirms the second scenario, is the presence of Isoran-like equipment within the Iron Hulk of a spaceship during the event of [Ghosts in the Machine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghosts_in_the_Machine/Iron_Hulk), suggesting that either Morai or Isorans had arrived to Cradle a few hundred of years prior to Skylark crash landing there. __If this has happened once, over a span of a hundred years, and given how ancient Isorans are as an interstellar civilization, the possibility of such event being repeated in the past is highly likely due to presence of the concept itself__.

Isorans had technology to allow interstellar travel for eons, it is then might not be a logical leap to conclude that at some point in time Isorans did in fact arrive to Cradle and their descendant became people of Almire and raiders, with the latter suspected to be one of the 2 kingdoms invading Almire. The detail of this state transitioning to the kingdom of Almire and raiders we will suggest in [the end of the analysis of the kingdom of Almire](#war-of-heavenly-kingdom-and-underworld).

##### Skylark

When thought of interstellar travel, it is believed that the time taken by the travel itself is considerably long, but, in case of Skylark and overall technological advancements of Spiral Order, this was solved, as based on the intro cinematic, Skylark has the required technology to travel those long distances.

Based on the earlier mention of eons regarding celestial cosmetics, Spiral Order or Isorans existed for quite a while, and such technology would be then expected or at least improved to the point it is seen currently.

Based on [Feron dialogue](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Reporting_for_Duty#Dialogue): `After the Skylark crashed, its primary tearium core exploded, destroying a portion of the ship and leaving it without a main power source`, a fuel called tearium is used to power the engine as well as the ship itself ([Reporting for Duty - Feron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Reporting_for_Duty#Dialogue)).

Skylark has at least 2 types of engines, one powered by tearium and one recovered and placed into the Lab, whose power supply is barely enough to power the complex, and it is designed similar to arcade gate pillars with distinct presence of Energy aura patterns.

We can identify the potential application of tearium through the analysis of the [intro cinematic](https://youtu.be/d5CrSNU-Wyg). Skylark, prior to reaching Cradle's star system was located in a tunnel. Based on the general understanding of Isoran advancements, we propose that it is a tangible, physical tunnel created by the vessel for long-distance travel, rather than a storytelling tool. In this proposed context we consider tearium as a fuel derived of "to tear", such as to tear regular space.

##### Thematic Connections of Isorans and Cradle

There are many items pointing to Isorans being related to Cradle:

- The aforementioned Raiders' [firestorm theme](#spiral-raiders).
- `Whether its crest is a relic from the Order of old or a creation from the Knights' time on Cradle is not immediately clear` ([Aegis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis)) - as discussed earlier, the vagueness here seems intentional.
- `The technique which weaves dragon scale seamlessly into the metal is a closely guarded secret` ([Azure Guardian Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Helm)) - as it was examined in relation to [both Spiral Order and dragons](#spiral-order-and-dragons), in the current context of Isoran origins it remains relevant.

  While dragons are in fact mentioned, the helm itself is of Spiral Order's medieval designs, and the set specifically lacks any relation to elemental or shadow, except for known piercing damage. So, this would mean that either dragons were present to some degree on Isora.

- `As it is often said, a knight need not have courage: just Valiance` ([Valiance](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valiance)) - a stretch, but it has similarity to Justice of Almire: `Law and Order have fled Almire. Only Justice remains, but she too has been twisted by the cursed flames that ravage our kingdom. Justice is now the burning scepter of our once great Lord Vanaduke. Justice is swift, unflinching, merciless` ([Legion of Almire/Inner Sanctum - Almirian codex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire/Inner_Sanctum)) in terms of how those concepts are referred.
- Cradle has much present spiral imagery, mentioned in the [Spiral section](#concept-of-spiral), it could be an appropriate location thematically for Knights to be related.
- The [Hazardous Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hazardous_Prize_Box) contains items relating to Scarlet Scouts:
  - `this helm is in the visage of a demon said to have broken off its own horn to use as a weapon when it faced its end.` [Hazardous Diablo Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hazardous_Diablo_Helm#Hazardous_Diablo_Helm) - a cultural presence of demons.
  - `this helm is in the visage of Death itself. Those that wear it have a saying, 'Death is at your heels, so keep facing forward'` ([Hazardous Grim Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hazardous_Grim_Mask#Hazardous_Grim_Mask)), - a personification of Death.
  - `this helm is in the visage of a fiend who lives in the mountains of a distant land. Said to guard the gate to heaven itself, it only allows those who are worthy to pass` ([Hazardous Oni Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hazardous_Oni_Helm#Hazardous_Oni_Helm)) - a cultural reference of Oni inhabiting mountains in Japanese folklore, and associated with thunder, which is present here as Storm-themed gear of the [Stormy Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stormy_Prize_Box).
- Among auras, the [Orbit aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Orbit_Aura#Orbit_Aura) has Cradle's Sun and Moon present, held by clock-like mechanism, in construction similar materials used in the [Celestial Saber](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Saber).

  Yet, it has imagery of Cradle's Sun and Moon, - this is _likely an asset reuse_, but we are not confident of that due to presence of the same imagery on the [Celestial Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Shield) - due to how the theme of equinox is related through Strangers to Cradle (`The Strangers pause at the equinox to recognize the brief moment of cosmic balance on Cradle. For just a breath of time, there is harmony between night and day, the sun and moon, and symmetry in the celestial sphere` - [Balance of the Equinox!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/98178)), and seemingly to Isoran culture (`To recognize this special event, Spiral HQ has created new costumes and accessories for the Knights of the Spiral Order. ..., and meditate on the workings of the universe. Then, refreshed, delve back into the clockworks with equipment that is out of this world!` - [Balance of the Equinox!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/98178)), despite located far from Isora.

Considering Isorans' advancements of interstellar travel, taken Skylark designs or designs of celestial cosmetics, they must have a homeworld or a place of origin advanced enough to, at least, allow traveling to planet's orbit. Based on descriptions of celestial sets, Isora is implied to be that homeworld, rather than our earlier suggestion of it being related to Cradle's past.

##### Similarity to Heavenly Kingdom

Another point of discussion, if the Knights were at some point on Cradle, - is the conditions of their arrival on Cradle or a separate planet which was taken up by the Core. Were Knights present at the time of [the War of Heavenly Kingdom](#war-of-dragons-and-valkyries)?

There are some parallels of Spiral Knights gear and warriors of Heavenly Kingdom:

- Presence of [Sun Silver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Silver), used in Almire-related gear and Azure Guardian Armor.
  - Application in [Azure Guardian Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Armor) and [Valkyrie Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Mail).
  - Revisiting [Aegis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis) and [Crest of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crest_of_Almire) shields. If Isorans were in fact ancestors of Almire, Crest of Almire then can be justified to be made in an image of Aegis as the latter is made by the Spiral Order: `Whether its crest is a relic from the Order of old or a creation from the Knights' time on Cradle is not immediately clear` ([Aegis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis)), but Spiral Order's instance of Crest of Almire is the most prominent [redesign](#technology-alchemy-and-Isoran-redesigns), specifically one that follows Aegis, but with the introduction of shadow defense in place of piercing.
  - Avenger line of swords ending with [Divine Avenger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Avenger) which might belong to [Heavenly set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Guardian_Armor), but most certainly comes from a different time and place, where curse was found and reversed, as seen in the swords design, - that is heavenly kingdom with knowledge of seals and evil eye imagery, as it will be discussed later in the [Legion of Ur section](#legion-of-ur).

Although this fact is presented only now, the history of valkyries being that civilization of heavenly kingdom seems to more thematically fitting, which would not fit to more militarized, less related to mythology, less fantasy-themed, Spiral Order, even in its earlier state before it took name of a Spiral Order.

This suggestion would then lead us to the prior idea of __gear of other civilizations being adapted to anatomy of Isorans through mastered application of alchemy__.

This would also mean, that there are 2 emerging scenarios:

1. Knights of old order arrived at Cradle and there their conceived armors and gear utilizing Sun Silver present there. Yet, for now we can't offer a solid foundation for the difference of technological advancement before and after this suggested event.

   In that regard we are yet to justify more fantasy-themed weapons, such as [Troika 5-star upgrades](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Troika#Alchemy_Path) and the [Cold Iron Vanquisher](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Vanquisher) line of Calibur, making it similar to [Almirian Crusader Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_Crusader_Armor) from the _design of alchemy tree progression_.

2. Dragons and Sun Silver would be universal to material realm, dragons were of different, primordial element, as it was earlier discussed, which would give them an unprecedented power nearing the gods. Although not associated with the gods in heavenly kingdom referred in [rider mantles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle), unless the it was of dragons, then this would raise an anachronism.

##### Lack of Damage Types

One important aspect to address - if Isorans are as old as Heavenly Kingdom and aware of it, they would likely know of Shadow and Elemental damage, but this did not happen, evident by:

- `An exceptional handgun that fires powerful, elemental shots that many Spiral Knights refer to as 'magic missiles'` [Arcana](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arcana) - elemental damage being referred to as magic.
- In Hall of Heroes, [Archilus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Archilus) tells that Owlites likely discovered elemental damage an it was adapted by the Spiral Order, so it was known technology, but not one used across entirety of the Order: `Elemental resistant armor and shields are adapted from Owlite technology. Though the Owlites themselves no longer exist, their amazing elemental mastery lives on in this gear`.
- `Phantamos represents one of the most recent additions to the Spiral Knight's arsenal, as containing shadow energy of this degree took a great deal of research` [Phantamos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Phantamos) - shadow damage was discovered on Cradle or very recently, before Skylark was launched.
- [Riftlocker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Riftlocker) and [Valiance](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valiance) on the other hand had already existed even during war at Morai.
- [Celestial Vortex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Vortex) and [Arcana](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arcana) are a few instances of elemental damage in Spiral Order's history.
- Earlier mentioned [Celestial Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Shield) being one of a few shields combining shadow damage and piercing defenses. Herein shadow damage is associated with cold - `Cradle's equinox inspired the dual nature of this specialist shield, which protects against the dazzling light of day and the chill of the night in equal measure` ([Celestial Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Shield)), - similar to [Winter Grave](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Winter_Grave) and [Permafroster](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Permafroster).

This would mean that [Sun Silver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_silver) - `An extraordinary metal imbued with the radiant light of the sky`, is ever-present as Shadow Steel. Here we also propose, that the [Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore), through its relation to heavens, we suggest it preceding Sun Silver, as yet unrefined ore becoming metal.

Moreover as heavens are referred to as a seemingly different realm, although given the mythological motifs, it can be related to a physical or metaphysical location of an unknown third realm: `An extremely rare metal of great power said to be from the heavens above` ([Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore)). The celestial naming scheme was repeated at least twice - in relation to Isorans and Valkyries.

Although addressed earlier, - if Spiral Order did arrive or emerge on Cradle, Cradle or composing it planets must have had to be far more advanced, at least same as the devices/gear of the implied celestials.

Ancient structures are preserved, as proven by presence of Scarlet Fortress and Tortodrones. The lack of knowledge of Spiral HQ's side on the shadow and elemental damage, as if it is was only present on Cradle in most powerful form, would suggest that the supposed dragons did not have those powers outside of related to the creation myth dragons.

By presence of primordial dragons, Isorans would discover shadow and elemental damage on their own far in the past. As for Spiral Order to extract their scales for the Azure Guardian Armor, some of them had to be present. A suggestion we would propose here, is that _only one family of dragons was present on Isora_ - such as dragons of rage as ones most related to normal damage, and not associated with frenzy/shadow nor divinity/storms/elemental damage.

Based on that knowledge, we lean to a conclusion of Isorans being an extraterrestrial to Cradle species. Cradle does not have technology more advanced than of Almire or of gremlins found on Cradle, apart from the event of the [Iron Hulk](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghosts_in_the_Machine). Cradle is not Isoran homeworld, but its inhabitants have similar myths to Isoran culture.

And, relating back to dragons, on Isora there were dragons of rage, demons within mountains, mythical personifications of Death.

From Isora interstellar expansion of Isorans began, at some point arriving to Cradle, as seen in case of the [Iron Hulk](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghosts_in_the_Machine). If celestial gear is considered, the technology of those times was advanced enough to allow existence of starships, similar to Skylark.

##### Padded Armor

On the other hand, in contrast to previous theme of [lack of damage types](#lack-of-damage-types), there is [padded armor alchemy tree](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Padded_Armor#Alchemy_Path), within which all damage types are present.

Based on [Woven Falcon Pathfinder Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Woven_Falcon_Pathfinder_Armor) - `A flexible suit of armor built for mobility and interlaced with slime fibers to protect against prickly and thorny foes`, we propose that those armors, as they adhere to the same design pattern, were all created in a small period of time, as potentially, Spiral Order's in-Universe solution for varying dangers of Clockworks. We arrive to this conclusion, as _slime family of monsters was only discovered on Cradle_. In this context, [Plated Falcon Pathfinder Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plated_Falcon_Pathfinder_Armor) - `A hardened set of armor made to protect against even the most voracious of monsters while exploring the unknown`, - seem to be referring to the unknown as to Clockworks.

The base [Sentinel Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sentinel_Armor) - `A suit of armor imbued with the power to repel the various afflictions that knights might encounter in the line of duty` refers to an elemental source, given its elemental defenses, which grants it ability to `repel`. This is similar to the [initial set of elemental armors](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Emberbreak_Armor): `Armor with a hacked elemental core aimed at resisting fire. However, this non-standard modification creates other elemental weaknesses` - with a `hacked core`. We suggest this power both to repel and resist is the same entity of a power core.

The [Woven Falcon Sentinel Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Woven_Falcon_Sentinel_Armor) 3-star line mentions a wolver: `A suit of armor imbued with interwoven wolver hair to protect against even the harshest elements` ([Woven Falcon Sentinel Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Woven_Falcon_Sentinel_Armor)), which sets it at least after the time wolvers are discovered. Weather wolvers were previously present on Isora is unknown, as such descriptions as `The Gloaming Wildwoods is home to packs of wild beasts that have proven deadly for squads in the past` ([Shadow of the Beast](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadow_of_the_Beast)) make it vague. This particular wording may be referring to a previous rank mission of [Strength in Unity](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Strength_in_Unity): `Something has riled up a pack of beasts in the Aurora Isles and they have descended upon a Geo Knight research team. Cornered, the team has sent a distress signal and Spiral HQ has issued the task of saving them to you`.

A 4-star [Plated Falcon Sentinel Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plated_Falcon_Sentinel_Armor) `A suit of armor reinforced with gremlin plating to defend against a range of dangerous elements` further suggests gremlins' specialization on elemental damage, which contradicts the fact constructs on Cradle are weak to elemental damage.

Finally, there is 2-star [Shade Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shade_Armor): `A suit of armor infused with dark matter that allows its wearer to shoot straight and surprise foes from the shadows`. Paired with [Plated Falcon Shade Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plated_Falcon_Shade_Armor)" `A suit of fiendish fabric interlaced with dark matter to conceal its wearer while they creep in camouflaged corners`, seems as if both dark matter and fiendish fabric were utilized after Skylark crash landing, rather than on Isora.

Due to all of those items' descriptions, we would consider padded armor's creation being located on Cradle.

#### Morai Wars

It is unknown for how long Morai Wars have already lasted, but it is known that during Skylark expedition it was not only ongoing, but severely crippling for Isorans. Several members of the Skylark crew had fought there, for example Euclid of the Alpha Squad - `Euclid wasn't your typical knight. By the time most in his division were getting their Squire crest, he had already achieved Vanguard. As a Squad Leader, he lead a series of successful assaults against the Morai during the liberation of Isora. A brilliant tactician, he was known for getting the job done with half the knights of other squads` ([The Pioneers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Pioneers#Dialogue)).

Current proposal, one that we derive from the discussion on the identity of Morai, is of another star system, containing planet or colony of Morai, is colonized by Isorans. But, this colony should not be too far for Isora to siege it: `These firearms proved instrumental during the siege of Isora in breaking through the war machines of the Morai` ([Riftlocker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Riftlocker)). The idea of Morai being located in a different star system can be affirmed both by [Skylark's](#skylark) identified __usage of tearium to open spacial tunnels, wormholes, to travel long distances__, and previously covered themes and descriptions of individual items found in the [Equinox Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Equinox_Prize_Box).

Isora was sieged by Morai, which is a possible reason behind lack of energy, as Morai in that position would have virtually all planetary surface and infrastructure covered.

The total lack of energy in this war was a reason behind Skylark expedition for another energy source. This would suggest that the homeworld of Isora could not provide that energy, and capable enough, likely after the siege of Isora, to at least launch those ships.

##### Celestial Bomb

Another suggestion, one that seems plausible in a setting of artificial planets with Cores of near-limitless energy, is based on the [Celestial Vortex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Vortex): `A Celestial Bomb modified with a payload of a dying sun`. If this is not considered a metaphor, then Isorans had to counter death of a star. And, considering bomb's usage and naming of a vortex, being similar to [Graviton](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graviton_Vortex) and [Electron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Vortex) vortexes, the result of the celestial vortex specifically could be related to a phenomenon of black holes or, in the context of graviton nature of the setting, a different method of opening up different realms. In case of graviton, it will be Underworld, as we will cover graviton technology in [its according section](#undercorps-graviton-technology).

This could render Isoran system potentially uninhabitable, but also give more context for the [Stellar Sentinel Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stellar_Sentinel_Suit) due to its description: `With this equipped, you feel like you could dive into the heart of a star`.

The ability to create bombs of this magnitude would also give a better understanding of Morai military power, as they are compared to Isorans, and framed as the greatest to date danger: `Euclid wasn't your typical knight. By the time most in his division were getting their Squire crest, he had already achieved Vanguard. As a Squad Leader, he lead a series of successful assaults against the Morai during the liberation of Isora. A brilliant tactician, he was known for getting the job done with half the knights of the other squads. ... After all, if you cut your teeth battling under Morai fire you could probably handle anything right? But maybe the Clockworks proved too much for even his ability` ([The Pioneers - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Pioneers)). It is known that Euclid survived: `Euclid volunteered to help The Sleeper. I'm sure he's in here somewhere battling The Swarm even as we speak` ([Dreams and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Refuge)).

And yet, the reasons for Morai war to erupt, remain unknown.

In the context of Morai and Isorans one thing in particular is left, a context of the [Ghost in the Machine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghosts_in_the_Machine) danger mission and technology of battlepods.

##### Ghosts in the Machine

Depth of [Iron Hulk](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Iron_Hulk) is located in the [dry docks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghosts_in_the_Machine/Dry_Dock) of the Clockworks. Dry docks are build in similar manner as Clockwork tunnels and deconstruction zones, both of which are constructed by gremlins and contained within a skydome, as long as this design is diegetic and not an asset reuse, which we have to keep in mind before building any theories.

In that context, paired with the [cargo bay](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cargo_Bay) and bridge-like room at the end of iron hulk behind the Big Iron battlepod, _we can identify the entire structure as a spacefaring vessel_. Moreover, uniform of pilots on the bridge is extremely similar to Isoran armors, such as [Stellar Sentinel Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stellar_Sentinel_Suit), which may prove that the spacecraft belong to Isoran or even Morai.

Why would this ship be on Cradle? To explain this, we introduce a following possible scenario.

From both warring sides starships are sent to search an energy source to assist at war: from Isora Skylark was sent, from Morai, on the other hand, a candidate can be presented in a form of ship which became the [Iron Hulk](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Iron_Hulk). Far earlier, depending on Skylark physics. As we have concluded that [Skylark](#skylark) can seemingly travel large distances utilizing a technology, allowing for creating tunnels, we can suggest, that this vessel was launched far earlier in the past.

Iron Hulk, for lack of a better term, either crash-landed or was captured on Cradle, as there are [dry docks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghosts_in_the_Machine/Dry_Dock) within which the vessel is placed. Weather dry docks were constructed for the ship, while it was transported at lower depths, or the ship safely arrived there, is unknown.

Considering sheer amounts of resources required to build Clockworks, the ship and its layout had remained mostly untouched, but rather sealed in the docks, with the cargo bay remaining as it was, the fact that it remained may point to a fact that it was a risky operation to salvage it. There are constructs surrounding the ship, which are of gremlin origin, as well presence of souls and undead, including undead [Dreadnaughts](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Deadnaught).

The only reason why gremlins had to contain it and not disassemble, is likely due to a greater risk, one introduced by the souls and gremlin vulnerability to shadow damage of undead, which are likely the crew influenced by the same phenomenon observed in the rest of the Clockworks and graveyards. As it was explored in the [graveyards section](#graveyards), zombies are seem to be undead Almirians.

This would mean that Isorans are also capable of being transformed into the undead after initial death, as explored in the [corporeal body section](#corporeal-body).

Then there is the crew at vessel's bridge. Their position indicated that the death was either sudden, or that they were already dead when the ship arrived to Cradle's surface, and that could be a reason behind haunting, as the undeath of Cradle is not seen by the Spiral Order anywhere else.

Yet, no other place apart from Cradle has the tendency of undead and spirits returning, meaning that the haunting had to happen on Cradle or in its proximity (`Why spirits return to the material realm is unknown` - [Weight of Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness)). This would not explain presence of [static souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Soul#Static_Soul), as the presence of souls on itself is a phenomenon, which, yet again, requires analysis of Cradle itself.

And then there is a battlepod - [Big Iron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Big_Iron#The_Big_Iron). Gremlins utilize battlepods in many instances, including rank missions. Presence of a unique battlepod within Isoran vessel is unconventional. Moreover, there are wires and cables connecting entire place. While they could be explained by the fact that this is an interstellar vessel, does not explain battlepod itself, as well as it being seemingly a focal point of spirits in control of the place, or their final line of defenses, as suggested by the quote:

`Do not hold back` / `WE WILL NOT HOLD BACK.`

This quote differs from the most, as it is the one of two instances of so called machine referencing itself, the other one is:

`They will kill us they will kill you.` / `THEY WILL KILL US THEY WILL KILL YOU.`

Here, as by missions name, inspiration must be sought in the 1993 film of the same name. The synopsis is that the soul of a serial killer is transferred to digital space of a computer network and electrical grid due to faulted MRI scan during electrical storm, which allowed him to continues his killings from the electrical grid and computer network. In the end, he was defeated through an introduction of a computer virus, which trapped him within a network segment and then through application of extreme magnetic field, killed him.

We can attempt to draw parallels with the events on Cradle in regards to the ship.

The entrapment part seems to be something implied by the presence of gremlin constructs. And to go not so far ahead of the timeline, this is one of a few instances of gremlins building their own containments against the shadow-related entities.

This would also suggest that some event might have caused this haunting. From many things related to undeath, energy of the Core could serve as a device which had caused the spirits to haunt the machines under some currently unknown conditions. Although we will cover the influence of Undercorp and Underworld in further sections, in relation to this theory, we believe that a less occult-like and related to Underworld reason stands for this shift between life and death across material realm.

Considering all of it, the battlepod might be seen as a security measure installed by gremlins during earlier time with the case of cargo bay, either constructed prior or post-factum the vessel arriving.

In relation to gremlins, due to lack of any candidates, they are the ones referred to as "they" by the machine:

`THEY WILL KILL US THEY WILL KILL YOU.`

As it was established by the lowercase ghost quotes, their "they" is the machine itself. The machine referring to somebody else, other then themselves, should point to a presence of a third party. Based on a conclusion that the battlepod and constructs of the cargo bay may belong to gremlins, may suggest that machine's "they" refers to gremlins.

Presence of the crew on the bridge would not be explained by this. Although an earlier discussed scenario can be reintroduced here, that those members of the crew were dead during the landing of the ship, but then above quote would not fit here, as the gremlins would not be ones responsible in that case.

##### Battlepods and Laser Technology

Then there are lasers of Big Iron battlepod. Their amount indicates presence of the similar to Roarmulus Twins technology, which in the latter case is the laser cannons, most clearly seen at the end of [Warfare Workshop of the Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory/Warfare_Workshop). The same cannons are installed into the Roarmulus Twins. But in case of the battlepod, their place takes circular set of artilleries hidden within battlepod's hulk.

If the idea of this battlepod being manufactured by gremlins is true, this would mean that [Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory) itself is also more that a hundred years old. Considering its dilapidated state, suggested both by internal design and naming such as its [Abandoned Assembly](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory/Abandoned_Assembly), it is highly possible. In that notion, the state of gremlin clans is also not seen as particularly stable, even if gremlin nature taken in consideration:

- King Tinkinzar is absent: `Tinkinzar not seen for many many years. Crimson Order carries out Tinkinzar's plans for Cradle. Emberlight was blight on master plan because built by outcasts. Haven was probably the same, founded by non-Gremlins` ([Pakrat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pakrat#Dialogue)).
- [Instability](#gremlin-military-industrial-complex) within the Crimson Order and explicit and likely recent power shifts.
- Emberlight still remains and is home for outcasts of the Great Colony: `Emberlight founded by Gremlin outcasts from Great Colony. Gremlins of Emberlight not obey the Iron Law, so flee or die. We start over with Emberlight. New colony home to few of us: most ex-schemers, some merchants, some fighters, all traitors in the eyes of Great Colony Gremlins` ([Pakrat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pakrat#Dialogue)).
- Cradle's defenses are not controlled by gremlins directly, as implied by the quote: `Once, the gremlins were in charge of maintaining Cradle's defenses. But they had their own plans` ([Dreams and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Refuge)), but as Skylark was shot down, we will return to the nature of those defenses in the [analysis of gremlins](#gremlin-empire).

Now, as for the **identity of the ship, we propose that it belongs to species of Isora**. Then it can be attributed to either Morai or Isorans, and as we suggest, it being the prior, mainly due to the fact that we know of them very little, and at the same time Spiral Order would have known of its interstellar vessel disappearing or at least be capable of identifying it though prominence of the Spiral Order insignia of a Spiral Warden. This emblem is not present in the Iron Hulk. On the other hand, there are cases of Raiders and kingdom of Almire being completely ignored or recognized as bearing or invoking any similarity to Isorans from their perspective.

### _Chapter `VI`_ Undercorp

Tortomega, the [titans](#chapter-titans), descendants of tortoises and far descendants of dragons, were pressed back into the wildwoods after a [war with valkyries of heavenly kingdom](#fiendisj-statues). Presence of a war taking place we proposed in the [analysis of decorated fiendish statues](#fiendish-statues) in the halls of several castle structures in Clockworks.

This conclusion we made based on the similarity of tortomega as a supposed civilization behind the prevalent ruins, and valkyries, as they both have significant element, attributed to norse mythology, specifically of Jotun, the giants, and valkyries and gods of Asgard, partially inspired by their relationship from the myths.

In the scenarios of titans being at war with valkyries or only assisting them in the construction of the castles, in [chapter 3](#ancient-titans) we concluded, that Gloaming Wildwoods and [Ancient Grove](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Grove) had to belong to titans' territory. And, due to a hypothesized location of [veiled homeland](#veiled-homeland), we proposed that Gloaming Wildwoods are not the birthplace of titans, with homeland referring to a location which, through the analysis of strata of ruins, fractured into [Aurora Isles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aurora_Isles), [Jigsaw Valley](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jigsaw_Valley), [Wolver Dens](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver_Den), and [Starlight Cradle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlight_Cradle).

As tortodrones are most recent physically present lead to understanding Tortomega, we will start this analysis from what was found during the long migration of tortodrones, specifically, in the [Ancient Grove](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Grove).

The connection between fiends of Undercorp and tortodrones is posed almost instantly, as to encounter working tortodrones, albeit in a corrupted state, Spiral Knights need to collect [fiendish glyphs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_ID_Card#Recipe) and make an [identification card](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_ID_Card) in order to gain access to the depths of Ancient Grove, wherein tortodrones are located, [Call of the Colossi](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Call_of_the_Colossi). Spiral HQ suggests that `the Fiends are somehow linked to the disappearance of those once-mythical beings` ([March of the Tortodrones](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones_(Mission)>)).

#### Ritual Circles, Circle of Art, Pentacles

We will start from a particular ritual circle around inactive tortodrone near the elevator at the end of [Call of the Colossi](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Call_of_the_Colossi) beyond the grim gates located in the [Ancient Grove](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Grove).

This circle has all of the same fiendish sigils, used occasionally across Clockworks in locations containing mineral pillars. Currently we will not analyze nature of those rooms in Clockwork tunnels. Circle of the same color, - pale white, - but smaller and without fiendish sigils can be found before the Call of The Colossi arena, surrounding inactive tortodrone part.

Based on the notion of fiends having in possession working but corrupted tortodrones, we can suggest, although it is a speculation currently, that those circles of different color and currently unknown mineral seem to possess a warding property, protecting the encircled entity. In our case, of an inactive tortodrone and its parts. We will revisit this speculation of the warding motif, developing it further, as we analyze the imagery of devilite ritual circles.

The identification of those tortodrones as ones being corrupted stems from the differences in the design, compared both to regular tortodrones found marching in the end of Call of the Colossi, and an enraged tortodrone depicted at mission's card. The corruption is visible mainly by presence of _purple color_, likely of dark matter, _cracked arms_, _stitched shells_, and _carved sigils on shell's plates in place of eyes_.

Fiendish ritual circles are purple, same as dark matter mineral, the circles found in the Call of the Colossi are ghostly white.

This practice of using different color is observed at the [Everfrost Tower](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Everfrost_Tower), in a [ritual circle in the Moorcroft Manor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Konjuring_Kat-Overworld.png), [Inner Sanctum](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Inner_Sanctum), and during [Departure of Shroud of Apocrea](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:SotA-Gameplay_End.png). Due to consistency of dark matter color, we can conclude that dark matter is not used in the latter instances, as they are not purple. Currently we won't consider different physics of the ritual circles depending on their mineral, but, it is important to note, that _there exists an aspect of minerals capable of being charged, which results, as we will soon see, in their color shifting_.

The sigils themselves, including ritual circles, seem to be inspired by the composition of Solomon seals or the pentacles from "The Kay of Solomon the King", and pinpointed to a few patterns, as suggested by [Kentngo on Spiral Knights forums](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/7857#comment-40758): `The Fifth Pentacle of Saturn combined with the meaning of the Seventh Pentacle of the Sun. Two circles, denoting the angels names between the two. The center shows a resemblance to the Third Pentacle of Mercury. Although the angelic names are gibberish in this case`.

<BookCitation source="The Key of Solomon the King">
  {#snippet markup()}

  The Fifth Pentacle of Saturn. This Pentacle defendeth those who invoke the Spirits of Saturn during the night and chaseth away the Spirits which guard treasures (p.60, fig.15).

  ---

  The Seventh and Last Pentacle of the Sun. If any be by chance imprisoned or detained in fetters of iron, at the presence of this Pentacle, which should be engraved in Gold on the day and hour of the Sun, he will be immediately delivered and set at liberty (p.66, fig.38).

  ---

  The Third Pentacle of Mercury. This and the following serve to invoke the Spirits subject unto Mercury and especially those who are written in this Pentacle (p.68, fig.46).

  {/snippet}
</BookCitation>

The idea of protection for dark matter circles is a novel one, but it follows along the previous concept of pale white circles as warding ones. The protected target is the one encircled - in case of devilites, or, likely gremlins, those are mineral pillars.

Then, through this logic, the pale circles indeed belong to a different party, as they had used a different mineral for those circles.

We suggest, that while the protection aspect persists, the later instances of ritual circles, ones relating to everfrost, and others to inner establishment of the Moorcroft Manor, demonstrate other abilities of the circles, namely capacity to summon - we will cover this in detail. So far, we are noting here, that __those circles are not drawn by fiends, but the consistent practice itself has to emerge from some culture, which we consider so far being from the Underworld__.

Previously mentioned idea of white circles serving as a ward, seems more plausible under those interpretations of protection. Moreover, the concept of the circle itself is introduced in "The Key of Solomon the King" and is called the _Circle of Art_:

<BookCitation source="The Key of King Solomon the King">
  {#snippet markup()}

  Verily, since no experiments for converse with Spirits can be done without shouldest wish to prepared, whatsoever experiments therefore thou wishest to undertake for conversing with Spirits, therein thou must learn to construct a certain particular Circle that being done surround that Circle with a Circle of Art for better caution and efficacy (Book 1, ch. II, "Of the Days, and Hours, and of the Virtues of the Planets").

  ---

  The which being finished, and the fumigations being performed, as is described in the chapter on Fumigations in the Second Book, the Master should reassemble his Disciples, encourage them, reassure them, fortify them, and conduct them into the parts of the Circle of Art, where he must place them in the four quarters of the earth, encourage them, and exhort them to fear nothing, and to keep in the places assigned to them (Book 1, ch. III, "The Construction of the Circle").

  ---

  The Medals or Pentacles, which we make for the purpose ot striking terror into the Spirits and reducing them to obedience, have besides this wonderful and excellent virtue. If thou invokest the Spirits by virtue of these Pentacles, they will obey thee without repugnance, and having considered them they will be struck with astonishment, and will fear them, and thou shalt see them so surprised by fear and terror, that none of them will be sufficiently bold to wish to oppose thy will (Book 1, ch. XVIII, "Concerning the Holy Pentacles or Medals.").

  ---

  Here followeth the Form of the Circle (see Figure 81), wherein whosoever entereth he shall be at safety as within a fortified Castle, and nothing shall be able to harm him (Book 2, sh. IX, "Of the Formation of the Circle").

  {/snippet}
</BookCitation>

It is due to those similarities and general themes found in the Key, we propose, that fiendish symbols in the ritual circles are derived from the shapes of symbols of Hebrew alphabet in "The Key of Solomon the King".

Lastly, fiends had carved one nowhere else seen sigil on corrupted tortodrones' back of the shell along with other commonly seen sigils, depicted as a __circled cross__. This description is closely similar to _pictograph of letter Teth "ê§à" of Phoenician alphabet_, and _Middle Semitic script_, and eventually evolving into the _letter Teth "◊ò" of early and modern Hebrew alphabet_, used in "The Key of Solomon the King". In the Key, Early Hebrew alphabet was at the foundation of the _Alphabet of Magic, used by the Key_, with an addition of several other systems, notably, Malachim alphabet. Then, from Hebrew alphabet, letter teth became __Theta "Œò" of Greek alphabet__. Malachim alphabet will be relevant in the context of the Underworld designs, discussed in regards to the [Nefarious Imp](#nefarious-imp-arctic-plot).

Letter theta, on par with our [suggestion](#technology-alchemy-and-Isoran-redesigns) of symbol of Salt - "üúî", - we can suggest, could be a prototype for the symbol of energy. If we are to integrate this idea, theta would serve as a symbol, but the meaning referring to alchemical salt. The symbolic meaning of pictograph of letter teth across Semitic script and Old Hebrew alphabet is connected to a depiction of a pot of a wheel, and of a connection to earth and nature.

The reminiscence of letter theta of the symbol of energy might mean an existence of several inspirations, as it was seen in prior chapters. So, for energy to possess same motif of using multiple sources is not out of the established pattern so far.

Considering presented Underworld cultural and linguistic motifs, could this cultural and linguistic relation to potentially alchemical or greek inspirations be extrapolated onto the relation between Underworld and civilizations of material realm which possess symbol of energy, weather it was heavenly kingdom or Isorans, albeit without involvement of titans?

##### Summoning from Underworld

Apart from those implied properties, which might help in establishing overall theme, there is one important element to ritual circles. Ritual circles can summon entities from locations beyond material realm.

There are 2 instances of such application of ritual circles is seen across Clockworks.

During the events of [return of the Legion of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur), devilites utilized ritual circles to summon banished to the Underworld trojans: `devilites are attempting to summon a legion of powerful trojan warriors. Based on intel from a devilite internal memo, the trojans are known as the 'Legion or Ur' ... the memo indicated that the Legion of Ur was sealed away in the Underworld and that an alternative approach would be required for bringing them back` ([The Return of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur)).

Here the alternative approach devilites had spoken of, is implied to be used during mission's events, that of ritual circles. Then this must mean, that an original approach should exist. Notably, from the same memo it is likely that whatever original approach was, it does not work for sealed in Underworld entities.

We believe that the original approach implied to exist, is the technology of grim gates. Considering that devilites use the ritual circle method on Cradle, and are considered stranded (`data collected from fiendish cities seems to indicate that they are now stranded on Cradle, much like us` - [Weight of Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness)), then there should be a reason why they did not use the gates, as it is the only other technology directly related to devilites.

The underlying grim gates technology, paired with relation to tortodrones is one of, if not the first, instances of Underworld presenting itself to known material realm.

For trojans, the solution was to utilize known sigils and draw ritual circles, pulling trojans from Underworld, as implied by depths' names and internal design:

- Depth of [Plazamonium](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_City/Plazamonium) is referred in the [mission](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur) as the `Summoning Circle` ([The Return of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur)).
- In that context `Dimensional Shift` ([The Return of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur)) may be identified as an area of dark cities surrounding the ritual site, and it is affected by something.
- A specific [scenario room](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-DevilishDrudgery_1.png) has a particularly large ritual site composed of 6 smaller ritual circles.

  The information module near the site states: `5 Ways to Appease your Pit Boss` ([Scenario Room](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scenario_room)), this might reveal more about internal corporate structure of Undercorp - that of unfamiliar utilized as mundane, - the _urban, corporate setting of devilites' dark cities is combined with the theme of mundane occult_.

To affirm potential role as a summoning mechanism, connecting Underworld and material realm, there is one single direct evidence of those rituals circles seen as capable of bringing entities to material realm. Although there is a notion of ritual circles utilizing different minerals, we won't currently consider it in order to emphasize the patterns themselves, connected to devilites, yet minerals may play a role in the exact laws of rituals.

In the Moorcroft Manor, black kat Margrel of the Kat Tribe is summoned through the process of applying incantation from the [Book of Dark Rituals](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Book_of_Dark_Rituals) to the [ritual circle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Konjuring_Kat-Overworld.png).

Margrel summoning is characterized by a formation of a dark-pink maelstrom enveloping the space below the manor. The maelstrom itself is extremely similar to one later observed across the grim gates, once [their open portal is destroyed at the end of devilite onslaught, with a blue-purple core](#grim-gtes-portal-collapse). We will look into the grim gates, as technology, soon enough. But, as of currently, it seems likely that in general, by the pattern of the ritual circle itself, entities can be brought in, and combined with the analysis of grim gates, the location in question is the Underworld.

A particularly large logical leap we had to take here, but one proposing a solution of how devilites entered material realm, is that tortomega being the ones who summoned devilites originally to a planet preceding Cradle though application of similar magic to one used with fiendish ritual circles, or by actions of Undercorp itself. In this proposal we consider white circles being devised after devilites' arrival, as the sigils do seem to belong to fiends.

The reasoning behind those 2 ideas of devilites arriving in proximity of the titans will be covered throughout the proposal itself, as we delve into specifics, but the gist of it is based around 2 major elements: [tortodrones' design containing "the eyes](#construction-of-tortodrones) and [existence of Snarbolax](#snarbolax), with an addition of Shadow Gloaming Wildwoods' [miasma](#miasma). The miasma exists largely on its own, and will be covered in the [analysis of Shadow Lairs](#analysis-of-shadow-lairs).

Considering that the dragons were a unique species in our thought framework, discovery of Underworld through their means, - through relation to dragons and inheritance of their abilities, - in case of tortomega, of potentially rage or frenzy. The latter could be the case, if we take [fiendish statues'](#fiendish-statues) depiction of tortomega as-is, rather than an interpretation, due to their design reminiscent of devilites.

If titans did uncover Underworld, likely a more rudimentary approach of _ritual circles_ was used, but so far, apart from white warding circles, there are no evidence of such action. The mention of a war with valkyries in the beginning in this context could be interpreted as a precedent for titans' research, or, Underworld would itself make appearance without major actions from titans.

#### Undercorp's Initial Advancements

With Underworld uncovered, devilites and Undercorp arrived with [Greavers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greaver). Greavers will be important at explaining further presence of the eye symbolism in relation to curse at the [evil eye section](#evil-eye).

Likely, combined efforts of Undercorp and tortomega allowed for a cooperation. During this period of time several technologies were either developed or introduced to material realm:

- Invention of [Graviton Bomb and Graviton Vortex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graviton_Bomb). Despite tortomega likely aware of power of frenzy or shadow, we think that the bomb was created after the arrival of devilites as it has an **ornament evil eye** present on it, uncharacteristic of _more simple design of the evil eye_ present of Greavers' helm. Bomb's design of the shell and its explosion's sigil has the same _ornament evil eye depicted_.
- Being similar to graviton bomb it its design - [Vortex Block](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Vortex_Block.png) seems to use the same gravity-related principles, contains a dark pulsating core, as it is present in those arenas. The diegesis of explosive blocks is also important, which we will [cover separately](#diegesis-of-explosive-blocks).
- Material, [Vile seal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vile_Seal) is utilized in alchemy of bombs and many shadow-related equipment. The seal itself is explicitly related by drop rate and description, to occult themes of Underworld: `A small scrap of ancient parchment imbued with dark magicks. It is believed that they grant power to those with evil souls`.

Weather grim gates were invented during this period of time is unknown, as they have strictly devilite imagery, compared to the rest of tech, which lacks it. As for the naming convention, there are also [grim totems](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Totem#Grim_Totem), which revive zombies from their skulls. Considering it, there are a few other items relating to death or Underworld in some ways though the naming convention of "grim":

- `Designed to frighten their enemies, this helm is in the visage of Death itself` ([Grim Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Mask)).
- [Grim Scarabs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Scarab#Grim_Scarab) which have relation to undeath and spirits during the [Dark Harvest Festival](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Harvest_Festival). We should keep in mind that Strangers are ones who celebrate this festival, and are aware of such entities as [Phantoms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Phantom) of [Graveyard](#graveyards), [scarabs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scarab), and [Pumpkin King](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pumpkin_King), as seen from the masks obtained from [Maskwell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskwell).
- `A small wisp of the essential spirit of darkness and decay` ([Grim Spark](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens))
- Although not related directly, [Grim Repeater](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Repeater), as it is a shadow damage weapon.

Based on a few such instances, it is likely that at least Grim Totems and Grim Gates are of Undercorp development or Underworld in general.

#### Grim Gates

Finally, the [Grim Gates](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones/Call_of_the_Colossi) were introduced to the material realm if not constructed in place, as means of large-scale transportation between Underworld and material realm with the base of operation in [Call of The Colossi](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Call_of_the_Colossi).

__This entire depth is referred as the "staging area"__ in [Morgral'm's memo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones/Ancient_Grove): `An ID Card is required to access the staging area. Properly presenting the ID Card will consume it to power the Grim Gate`, highly suggesting that this area had its own dedicated role for Undercorp's operations in material realm.

The term "staging area" is usually used in relation to logistics, construction, aviation and military, but all of them mean essentially the same - a point of arrival, departure, or transit, wherein preparations are made. We will keep this definition in mind.

The depth itself is locked behind [Fiendish ID Card](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_ID_Card) and has large amount of gates, aligning well wth the above description. The area is connected to, likely, the Underworld, as seen by the _dark city interior with an opened portals in the gates_, with an inactive tortodrone in sight. This side of the gates will be visited shortly.

Grim Gates are powered by the glyphs, as those are used to create the [card](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_ID_Card) and carried by fiends ([Fiendish ID Card](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_ID_Card), `An ID Card is required to access the staging area. Properly presenting the ID Card will consume it to power the Grim Gate` - [Morgral'm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Morgral%27m)), sharing more information on the underlying principles of portals' physics.

##### Fiendish Glyphs

Naming convention of glyphs with their appearance may shed some light on the inspirations and principles behind Underworld and devilites in general through recognition of a common motifs and themes.

There are 5 fiendish glyphs in total required to construct a fiendish identification card, which also functions as power source for the gates: `An ID Card is required to access the staging area. Properly presenting the ID Card will consume it to power the Grim Gate. Remember: "When you Use it, you Lose it"` ([March of Tortodrones - Ancient Grove - Fiendish Memo: Morgral'm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Grove)). This fact alone suggests that _those glyphs have an internal power capacity, similar to minerals_, as they will be [discussed later](#minerals-and-souls-part-1).

Glyphs' icons in the inventory also provide more context on their nature. Here we apply a similar concept of the diegetic interface of the game, where materials are also fall under Spiral Order classification. In the inventory, glyphs are _depicted as essences_, or __metaphysical elements__, yet being identified as glyphs - characters in a writing system. We establish this motif based on other instances of this inventory icon being used:

- `A powerful essence that left behind when a creature perishes during a blind, fiery rage` ([Flame Soul](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul)).
- `A rare elemental found hovering in storm clouds. Their electric hum creates an almost melodic choir that can be faintly heard between thunderclaps` ([Storm Chaser](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Chaser)). While it differs thematically from the rest, we must keep in mind, that its original name - of the material - was Spark of Life (`The old ‚ÄòSpark of Life‚Äô crafting material has been renamed to 'Storm Chaser'` - [Release Notes: 2013.07.30](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2013-07-30)).
- `A powerful essence left behind when a creature perishes from a particularly putrid disease` ([Plague Essence](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plague_Essence)).
- `A small patch of ice crystals that never seem to melt, even when exposed to direct heat` ([Everfrost](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Everfrost)).
- `A mote of burning energy salvaged from Lord Vanaduke's throne room. It slowly smolders with a sinister intensity, creating an almost hypnotic trance when gazed upon for any length of time` ([Dark Ember](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember)).

Thos instances suggest, that it in not the representation of a burninig fire, rather than one including it into a greater concept, which extends into properties of materials, not usually found in material realm, - that is the reason behind us refering to those objects as metaphyscal essences. In this regard, the very name of essences is internally referenced by the code as essences, to represent those materials.

The glyphs have color, one that can be related to minerals, although currently this may be an attempt of fitting similarities:

- Name [Amu Glyph](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_Amu_Glyph), color pink, relation to crimsonite: `said to contain the passion, anger and strength of the life surrounding it`.
- Name [Nok Glyph](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_Nok_Glyph), color green, relation to valestone: `said to contain the essence of all natural life`.
- Name [Sol Glyph](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_Sol_Glyph), color yellow, relation luminite: `said to contain the faith, wisdom, and zeal of the life surrounding it`.
- Name [Tor Glyph](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_Tor_Glyph), color blue, relation to moonstone: `said to contain the knowledge and origins of all worlds`.
- Name [Ur Glyph](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_Ur_Glyph), color purple, relation to dark matter: `said to contain the essences of both chaos and nothingness`.

This concept of color relation, apart from glyphs' color, is found in the texts of "The Key of Solomon the King", which might connect our colors to ones described in the Key through an alchemical interpretation and symbolism found in the descriptions of aforementioned Cradle minerals:

<BookCitation source="The Key of King Solomon the King">

  These Pentacles are usually made of the metal the most suitable to the nature of the Planet ; and then there is no occasion to observe the rule of particular colours. They should be engraved with the instrument of Art in the days and hours proper to the Planet.

  Saturn ruleth over Lead; Jupiter over Tin; Mars over Iron; the Sun over Gold; Venus over Copper Mercury over the mixture of Metals; and the Moon over Silver.

  They may also be made with exorcised Virgin paper, writing thereon with the colours adopted for each Planet, referring to the rules already laid down in the proper Chapters, and according to the Planet with which the Pentacle is in sympathy.

  Wherefore unto Saturn the colour of Black is appropriated Jupiter Mars over Red the Sun over Gold, or the colour ruleth over Celestial Blue of Yellow or Citron; Venus over Green; Mercury over Mixed Colours; the Moon over Silver, or the colour of Argentine Earth (Book 1, ch.

  (5.) Five Pentacles consecrated to Venus=Green.

  (6.) Five Pentacles consecrated to Mercury=Mixed Colours.

  (7.) Six Pentacles consecrated to the Moon=Silver.

  (Book 1, ch. XVIII, "Concerning the Holy Pentacles or Medals").

</BookCitation>

While this is not a direct mapping, we suggest it is a pattern, emerging in many different mediums, as those derive their identity from elements rooted in reality. Using this framework as an approximate guide, we may identify those similarities through color as ones to be intentional, although apart from thematic element, we do not have physical evidense of those groups be connected within the set cosmology.

The names of glyphs are also found in [fiendish cities](#dark-cities) of `Amu-Sol` and `Sol' Fork`, and fiendish legion of Ur consisting of trojans. The application of names across dark cities may suggest that glyphs may hold multiple meanings to them, not as letters, but words or concepts, which refclect glyphs' specific purpose, given their variety of color.

Then there is legion of Ur. The presence of Ur name in legion's name, if taken from real world history, implies Ur being legion's commander, a single entity. Other clue stems from the history of the Roman Empire. Their legions' names had a nomenclature: numerical, which is not relevant here, and titled. The latter case seems applicable to this legion. In that context, Ur may still be a figurehead's name.

Here we suggest a following interpretation: if the inspirations of "The Key of Solomon the King" are taken into account, with addition of pup-cultural meaning, then glyphs, as written characters, have power to spell entities' names, names of devilites and deities. This may not conflict with the mentioned concept of glyphs, as it is likely there are more of them - as names like Morgral'm exist.

Then there is application of glyphs in the semi-technological context. In the [Golden Slime Casine there are a few Pit Bosses](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Golden_Slime_Casino), which state:

- `Productivity is up two percent since I started mandatory overtime.`
- `I promoted myself to Senior Manager of Ghastly Implements of Destruction.`
- `I worked my employees hard to get where I am today.`
- `I just put in another bulk order for office supplies. We keep running out.`
- `The guy in Devil-IT wanted to upgrade our office to all glyph-usage, but I like wasting paper when I can.`

Among those lines, 2 seem particularly important, whish suggest esitence of a different department of Undercorp alongside _Resource Allocations_ and _Eternal Torment Division_: _Ghastly Implements of Destruction_. But in the context of glyphs it is established, that _those can be used across offices as a replacement for paper_: `The guy in Devil-IT wanted to upgrade our office to all glyph-usage, but I like wasting paper when I can` ([Golden Slime Casino - Pit Boss](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Golden_Slime_Casino)). This quote does not explicitly reveal the purpose of glyphs, but suggests it to be a data storage meadium, more efficient as the paper medium.

With this we have 2 very different purposes, or rather, applications of glyphs - as an __energy storage__, and a __data storage__, _scalable enough to replace paper across the office_. As devilites are stated (`Spiral HQ suspects that the glyphs that the Fiends carry with them might be the keys to opening the gate yourself` - [March of the Tortodrones](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones_(Mission))) to carry glyphs with themselves, this suggests the __glyphs to be mass-produced__.

Combined with the depictions of fiendish sigils which may or may not be the same glyphs may potentially reveal a following scenario.

If those sigils are glyphs, and the prior are made of dark matter, this may, in the course of the [Minerals and Souls section](#minerals-and-souls-part-1), make _glyphs to be energy carriers as much as minerals contain energy_, which would explain the logic behind power source of the Grim Gates. Weather glyphs are made of dark matter - remains unknown.

These cases of glyphs' application, close relation to souls and energy, we suggest, may reveal an existence of a __soul or energy-based economy of Underworld__, with souls as an external conduits for energy to native energy mediums of glyphs.

##### Relation to Deities

As there are 5 known glyphs, with at least 2 fiendish cities having names which are partially made of those glyphs' names, could it be that glyphs could also refer to Underworld deities?

We believe this distinction must be brought up. On the other hand, there are deities likely inhabiting Underworld, as stated by [Wicked Idol](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wicked_Idol): `One of many statuettes carried by fiends as a means of gaining favor with their dark gods`.

Those deities could in fact be [Hail deity](#influences-of-undeworld), [Vile deity](#fiendish-cults), and [Magma deity](#fiendish-cults). [Magma deity](#fiendish-cults) specifically, we believe, is Vog, - by the fact of both exerting fiendish influence or themes. We will also propose of those deities being located in the Underworld,[explored later in relation to Lord Vanaduke](#king-in-the-mountain).

Considering naming convention of glyphs, Vog could plausibly fit there as a name for a fiendish glyph. The latter scenario of those entities, such as Ur, being immortal, can be implied by the name of a division, referred by Morgral'm: `As your division's disciplinary action will undoubtedly result in relocation to the Eternal Torment Division, this will likely be our final correspondence. I wish you luck in your continued career here at Undercorp` ([Morgral'm - Fiendish Memo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Morgral%27m)). This results in an idea, related to physiology of devilites - are devilites immortal? While we dont't have information regarding it, we can explore other aspects of Underworld enterprizes.

##### Undercorp's Graviton Technology

Grim Gates, while of Undercorp development, as seen by the devilite carvings, are based on the same gravity technology by which [graviton bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graviton_Bomb) operates. Yet, the gates have the capacity to transport living beings, as suggested by the function itself. This requires for _2 gates to be opened to sustain a stable connection_ across material realm or the Underworld. A mechanism can de deduced form the gates' behavior when interacted in the Ancient Grove, as the Call of the Colossi depth starts from the gates' platform.

When activated, grim gates generate a vortex, the same one observed in vortex blocks and graviton bombs. After the vortex forms, a portal at its center opens depicting a dark city-like interior with an inactive tortodrone in sight.

But when vortex of Vortex block or Graviton bomb is presented, instead of a portal, a dark sphere of pulsing matter is only visible during their initial activation phase prior to explosion.

If grim gate's portal is broken in its active or opened state, it explodes in a fiery explosion similar to an [explosive block](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Exploration). Apart from those similarities there is one important element of portal's life cycle.

##### Grim Gates' Portal Collapse

As seen in the [Call of the Colossi](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Call_of_the_Colossi), the portals are linked in, at least, pairs. The behavior of devilites seen in danger rooms during tortodrones' Long Migration as well as in the [Call of the Colossi](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Call_of_the_Colossi), - after all present devilites or tortodrones are removed, currently opened portals explode in the same gravity explosion observed in [Vortex Block](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Vortex_Block.png), which over time transforms into much larger, more powerful maelstrom of fiendish pink hue with a flat dark purple core. This __purple maelstrom likely is a result of an open portal on devilite's side being forcibly closed__.

By severing the connection, _something of Underworld nature bleeds into the material realm identified by the pink hue_. In that state the gates may point to a location of no return, as no established portal, a lack of required tech of grim gates themselves would allow for a proper connection, or, more likely, a one-directional connection. This is likely true as the same maelstrom phenomenon is observed in one other case - during resurrection of [Margrel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Margrel) through the usage of a [Book of Dark Rituals](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Book_of_Dark_Rituals) as discussed in the [summoning section](#margrel-and-immortality-through-curse). The event itself will be analyzed in its appropriate section, but currently only its context is important in relation to the vortex, one attributed to presence of curse associated with this dark-pink color scheme and s broken connection to Underworld. If we take this idea further, _Vortex block and Graviton bomb are weaponizing this phenomenon of improperly crossing realms_.

It was established earlier that the [Ancient grove](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones/Ancient_Grove) was part of the [Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gloaming_Wildwoods). But, Ancient Grove, compared to the Wildwoods, has ruins different from ones present in both locations. This is likely due to it having a special role in titans' culture.

The lager gates used to specifically access the staging area use tortodrone tech, tortodrone arms with possible crimsonite within, as based on the red light emanating from those components. Crimsonite will be further expanded upon. But currently, we may suggest that a much larger gates could have been used to transport devilites and potentially entire cities into the material realm, taken presented variation in grim gates' scale.

Another suggestion can be also made here - "armed" grim gates are the initial portal through which a connection is made. When Spiral Knights arrived to the Ancient Grove, the portal was already active but locked, while the other side does not have the characteristic arms as well as seemingly gremlins' monitors as an interface. Could it be that the portals in Undercorp's possession are constructed in similar manner and linked to portals near the Ancient Grove? Currently, considering all of earlier instances and similarities, this proposal holds up.

#### Snarbolax And <span class="through-curse">Haunting Through Curse</span>

The described [portal collapse](#grim-gates-portal-collapse) seemingly releases curse into the material realm, identified by its hue.

We propose, that this usage of the gates, paired with other [weaponized graviton technology](#undercorps-graviton-technology), with the presence of curse had its own effects onto the region, for reasons we will discuss later in this section. The curse, originating from the grim gates, had settled in nearby wildlife, most evident by the presence of Snarbolax within the Gloaming Wildwoods and later introduction of the [miasma](#miasma).

Snarbolax will serve here the first most distinct case study of __curse afflicting creatures of material realm not by detriment, but empowerment__. Here it is important to analyze nature of Snarbolax in that proposed context.

Gloaming Wildwoods were inhabited by a [Snarbolax](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Snarbolax). Items made of its fur (`A coat of coarse fur taken from a Snarbolax` [Nightmare Mane](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nightmare_Mane)), as well as a few others, have a focus on dangers of sighting Snarbolax. Snarbolax has seemingly supernatural presence going beyond its supposed death during knights' passthrough of the Gloaming Wildwoods:

- Snarbolax itself has a default state of invincibility with a [shadow color scheme](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Category:Shadow-Themed). Dispelled invincibility or stunned state reveals Snarbolax's more [natural fur coat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Monster-Snarbolax_stunned.png), similar to [wolvers' 3 color pattern one of which is white accent](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Monster-Alpha_Wolver_3.png). Rabid Snarbolax is poison themed, possibly relating to the [poison-themed cults](#fiendish-cults). On the other hand, the [fur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nightmare_Mane) acquired from the Shadow Lairs is of color belonging to a shadowed state.
  - Equipment made of this fur - [Snarbolax Cap](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Snarbolax_Cap) and [Snarbolax Coat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Snarbolax_Coat) both state: `Even looking at it too closely is dangerous`, although currently this could be a hyperbolized writing, we believe it will gain larger connotation in the context of next few items presented.
- Barbarous [Thorn blade](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Barbarous_Thorn_Blade): `Those who wield it claim to feel the fiery stare of the beast upon them whenever they close their eyes`. The charge attack has a ghostly image of Snarbolax performing a bite, similar to ghostly apparitions of wolver in case of [Wild Hunting Blade's charge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wild_Hunting_Blade) and a larger wolver with a snarl and wide red eyes reminiscent of [Maulos' Perma-Frostifurs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver#Perma-Frostifur). This blade, notably, also has a poison counterpart - [Dread Venom Striker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Venom_Striker).
- Dark [Thorn Blade](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Thorn_Blade) which is upgraded to [Barbarous Thorn blade](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Barbarous_Thorn_Blade), the prior specifies that it is a `savage sword whose strength has been fortified by an offering of souls to the beast within`. With the beast most certainly referring to the Snarbolax.
- Twisted [Snarble Barb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Twisted_Snarble_Barb) has color scheme of a stunned Snarbolax with its overall green hue and lime-like color reminiscent of [Rabid Snarbolax](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rabid_Snarbolax) thorns.
- Dark [Briar Barrage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Briar_Barrage) on detonation summons ghostly apparition of Snarbolax, with a matching description: `A mythical object that can explode with the fury of the Snarbolax itself. The unearthly howl it produces is said to be more crippling than its blast`.
- Barbarous [Thorn Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Barbarous_Thorn_Shield) imitates Snarbolax's three-eye pattern and states the following: `its said the beast can use the glowing orbs on the shield's face to see and stalk weak-hearted wielders`.
- Dark [Thorn Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Thorn_Shield) plain specifies: `A gloomy guard that gives one's sword strikes a supernatural savagery`.
- Statues of Snarbolax - [Replica Natural Snarbolax](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Replica_Natural_Snarbolax) and [Replica Shadowy Snarbolax](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Replica_Shadowy_Snarbolax) seem to suggest a definitive, natural, version of Snarbolax.

Based on all of those items it seems, that Snarbolax has a few supernatural properties. There are no enemies, and especially of beast family on Cradle, which would possess such powers, with the exception of [Perma-Frostifurs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Perma-Frostifur#Perma-Frostifur).

##### Perma-Frostifurs and Blinding Abyss

Perma-[Frostifurs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Perma-Frostifur#Perma-Frostifur) are invincible and are not delivered from Undercorp, given [Fiendish Memo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Amu-Sol), as they are absent in the description of the requested items: `Please provide a detailed summary of your projected use of the following requested resources: - 999 'Open minded' devilites ... - 50 barrels of 'whatever frostifurs eat' ... - A 'towering pillar' of everfrost and 'all the frozen souls it brings forth'` ([Heart of Ice - Amu-Sol - 'Fiendish Memo'](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Amu-Sol)).

If we attempt to draw parallels of [Underworlds' influence](#underworlds-influence), we can suggest, that as Vog cubs are transformed by a magma deity, so are Perma-Frostifurs are transformed by a Hail deity in the same manner as we see Maulos and Lord Vanaduke.

Placement of the Blinding Abyss in that regard can be explained by an interpretation of Underworld paired with frost themes of Blinding Abyss as partially inspired by a layered structure of Hell in "Dante's Inferno", wherein the Ninth Circle, compared to the rest, had themes of ice, water, and frost. Blinding Abyss can relate either to the Underworld itself, as it was referring to an entire structure of "Dante's Inferno" Hell, reaching to the center of the Earth, or, a more ancient archetype found across myths. This idea, we believe, was integrated within the structure of Underworld - as Underworld is a different realm, the cosmology also is required to cover now metaphysics of not the single realm, but multiple. As in the Underworld do exist [devilites](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Devilite#Types) and [greavers of different elemental types](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greaver#Types), we propose, that __Blinding Abyss is located within and below the Underworld, in the process becoming a different realm of frost, identified by its name__, same as the Abyss of "Dante's Inferno" was reaching bottom of the World.

##### Cursed Fur

Returning to Snarbolax, there is such wording as `supernatural savagery`, `unearthly howl`, and mention of souls in the [Barbarous Thorn blade](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Barbarous_Thorn_Blade). We propose that all of the above characteristics imply relation to Underworld, as it is one of 2 primary actors concerned with souls. Specifically, _Snarbolax became cursed through an influence of Underworld_.

The final and most evident, as we see it, argument towards intrinsic connection between Snarbolax and curse emerges from 2 items when they are analyzed together:

- Snarbolax's fur - [Nightmare Mane](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nightmare_Mane), - is described here: `A coat of coarse fur taken from a Snarbolax. Each fiber seems to curl and fray as if life is still flowing through it`.
- The [Snarbostuffing](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Snarbostuffing) refers to fur as cursed, as does not decay in its presence: `A dense, fluffy stuffing made from a special polymer that doesn't break down when exposed to the cursed fur of the Snarbolax. Its perfect for creating trophies or adorable, cursed, stuffed toys` ([Snarbostuffing](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Snarbostuffing)).

This recontextualizes Nightmare Mane's description - `seems to curl and fray as if life is still flowing through it` within the idea of life after death by a presence of lingering life. This idea of lingering was also attributed to souls: `The dust of the departed. Whether it still retains any shred of a soul remains to be seen` ([Soul Dust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul_Dust)).

If the curse indeed lingers, how it was achieved? We suggest that the source of this supernatural power is the result of improper usage of grim gates near the ancient grove, as the resulting explosions of the portals, discussed earlier have a characteristic, associated with the curse, dark-red and pink mist, present when portal explodes from the other side.

The curse affects only living creatures. Depending on its source, it can be fully detrimental - as in case of Spiral Knights and Nature Sprites, or come with additions - as in case of [Lord Vanaduke](#king-in-the-mountain), and at least for Snarbolax's fur, as living after owner's death.

Considering the absence of tortomega and suggested here and by tortodrone mission description (`Investigations into the cause were inconclusive, but Spiral HQ suspects fiends are somehow involved` - [March of the Tortodrones](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones)), connection with devilites and Undercorp, this scenario of Underworld's influence on material realm wildlife would be particularly plausible, likely being the exact [pink miasma found in the Shadow Gloaming Wildwoods](#miasma). Apart from this miasma and a potential offering of souls in [Dark Thorn Blade](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Thorn_Blade): `A savage sword whose strength has been fortified by an offering of souls to the beast within`, - the method through which Snarbolax became cursed in the first place, is related to the past presence of Titans in the woods.

Under this assumption, we can also explain general thematic shift of alchemy tree of high-tier Snarbolax gear. Last 2 tiers of equipment, 5 and 4 stars', are themed around shadowy Snarbolax, while 2 and 3 star gear is seemingly attributed to stunned or natural Snarbolax, without any explicit supernatural influence.

At that, we propose, that items acquired for [Frumious Fang tokens](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Token#Frumious_Fang) exist within an _alchemy tree representing a transformation from natural to supernatural_. Similar, if not exact themes, we believe, are present in the descriptions and context of Snarbolax trophies:

- `A small Snarbolax statuette, showing the savage shadow in a stunned state` ([Replica Natural Snarbolax](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Replica_Natural_Snarbolax)).
- `A large model Snarbolax, depicting in minute detail his jaws that bite and claws that catch` ([Replica Shadowy Snarbolax](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Replica_Shadowy_Snarbolax)).

It seems to us that the name of natural and accompanied Snarbolax's design solidifies it as different state of being from the latter - shadowy, in which Snarbolax is invincible.

As a side note, the grouping of [Snarbolax Slippers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Snarbolax_Slippers#Snarbolax_Slippers) with the rest of wolver families' slippers in the [cozy prize box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cozy_Prize_Box) may suggest that Snarbolax was at some point in time a wolver, or an adjacent specie. And based on the [Snarblepup](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith_(Snarblepup)>) reskin of Maskeriath battle sprite, we can practically confirm Snarbolax being a canid, despite its muzzle's shape.

#### Tortodrone Equipment

As grim gates possess strictly Undercorp-themed design, they related to tortodrones through the usage of their arms in the [Ancient Grove](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Grove) [gates](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Grim_Gate.png).

We will start from a few alchemical recipes of tortodrone equipment that had remained and found in the [Mysterious Alchemy Machine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mysterious_Alchemy_Machine).

Among them are found such items as combination of tortomega and [Gorgo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgo) - [gorgomega](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgomega). But, Gorgomega's recipe is made of mostly Underworld-related materials in its alchemy, which does relate to gorgos. But what does belong to tortomega? The only material used there and is unrelated to Underworld directly is the [ancient shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Shell).

The shield itself is an upgrade of [Nether Shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nether_Shell) which is stated to be `alchemized from the shell of a corrupted tortodrone` ([Nether Shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nether_Shell)). Does this mean that corrupted tortodrones were already present in the far past? It may be so, but no evidence of that is explicitly found. Unless, we consider seemingly supernatural properties of Mysterious Alchemy Machine as one not requiring recipes.

At the same time, elemental shield and its alchemy path like [Omegaward](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omegaward) are seem to be constructed much later, as they utilize Owlite and undead-related materials - [Philoso Feather](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Philoso_Feather) and [ghost bell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghost_Bell).

There is also [Savage Tortoise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Savage_Tortoise), it has piercing defense, stating that `even a rampaging wolver pack would have a hard time puncturing its reinforced plates` ([Savage Tortoise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Savage_Tortoise)). The shell itself is said to be hardened: `A shield alchemized from a hardened tortodrone shell` ([Savage Tortoise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Savage_Tortoise)). As the defenses are piercing and the materials there used are [Dragon Scale](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale) and [Critter Carapace](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Critter_Carapace), they seem ones giving this defense. Unless somewhere across Cradle roams a hardened shell tortodrone, this period of time, when the shield was invented, remains unknown. Although, considering that Spiral Order had experience of using dragon scales in their own alchemy, and presence of wolvers in the description, might actually suggest that piercing-resistant variant of the shell was devised by the Spiral Order on Cradle.

As for the [Grand Tortoise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Tortoise) - it seems to be the one most significant in overall context of tortodrone-derived technology. It will be kept in mind for the analysis of a relation between tortodrones, crimsonite, and concept of rage. Considering that the starting item of the alchemy tree is the [Plate Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plate_Shield), it might only support the idea of _alchemy superseding time and causality on Cradle_, as a shield similar to the prior is used by gremlin [Mortafires](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mortafire). The [Royal Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Core) material, on the other hand, seems anachronistic as the slimes had arrived on Cradle only recently. This material then seems like a substitute, present in the current environment after Skylark's crash landing.

#### Undercorp's Plot: Creation of Tortodrone

Weather the aforementioned equipment has existed by the time titans encountered Undercorp, we can more certainly suggest, that both grim gates require resources larger, than can be likely passed through the ritual circles. Due to this we place grim gates and tortodrones as temporally close, with the gates being the first, as they are the device to connect both realms. Only then tortodrones had to be engineered.

As tortodrones resemble bipedal tortoises, and the established timeline makes point on presence of tortomega civilization, here we suggest that tortodrones are based on tortomega design-wise, with the [Omega Shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Shell) likely serving as the anatomical basis for tortodrones' shells.

Moreover, we can gather that invention of tortodrones was a collaborative effort. Curse is characterized by symbol of an opened eye, one present on tortodrone shell and, more importantly, on metallic helms and wing patterns of [Greavers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greaver). None of the ruins present across Clockworks and Wildwood have eye symbolism, apart from the [heavy statues](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Statue#Heavy_Statue), they will be kept in mind for further analysis.

Tortodrones are built in similar manner to Gun Puppies of tier 1 as [tortomega' stone constructs](#stone-constructs), already present during [the war of dragons and Heavenly kingdom](#war-of-dragons-and-valkyries). The main element, which ties both gun puppies and tortodrones is a _protective stone exterior and mechanical internals_. There is [stone tortoise shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stone_Tortoise), which made of stone: `A large, powerful shield made to resemble a creature's shell` which may or may not had turned to stone by that point in time, attributing to the timelessness of [dragon scales](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale).

_When tortodrone is defeated, it turns to stone, similar to a trojan_, one associated with the Legion of Ur and Underworld, but also containing dark matter crystal embedded into it. _Weather it is dark matter what influences this process of petrification, is unknown_, as well as dark matter is the only mineral capable of this process. But, as inactive tortodrones are also found across Clockworks, and they are not seen as corrupted, we lean to tortodrones being constructed from stone in the first place, rather than becoming one through destruction of the supposed dark matter crystals.

Why tortodrones were manufactured? Most of the hints are located an the ancient grove and depth below - call of the colossi, as well as Morgral'm memos.

In the same memos a staging area is mentioned - `An ID Card is required to access the staging area` ([Fiendish Memo (from Morgral'm)](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Grove)), - it is likely the location through which both devilites and tortodrones were sent, as on the other side of the grim gates a dark city interior with vials and an inactive tortodrone is presented.

There are a few locations in the dark cities containing corrupted tortodrones as well as large deposits of dark matter in a seemingly more natural state, compared to the protected pillars in the Clockworks. The very fact that dark cities with names derived of devilite culture are present in the Clockworks, as described in [dark cities section](#dark-cities), combined with larger grim gates and torn state of dark cities, it is safe to assume that those cities, unless they they were not devilites', came from the Underworld. This would require then either preexisting Undercorp colony, or there are transported through a much larger grim gates not seen in the Clockworks. In case of the cities arriving later in the timeline, grim gates still would remain as an important element to Undercorp's plot, involving tortodrones.

Considering that dark matter is found in those cities and labs, as [here](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Area-Devilish_Drudgery-Scenario_Room5A.png) and [here](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-DevilishDrudgery_2.png), it is likely that tortodrones were at least reconstructed in the Underworld and delivered to the material realm, as well as _allowing for dark cities to exist already by that point in time_.

The original construction, that is the shell, carvings and moving parts, judging by the rest of the Wildwoods, was done in the material realm. If they were built in the Underworld, it is likely that they would've been made of the same metal that was used in weavers' helms - with a symbol of a evil eye, as it is used often as an armor, making it expandable. Herein, shell do contain eye imagery, but are of stone.

Then the question rises - why Undercorp would transport tortodrones? We suggest that this was done later, as part of Undercorp's plot to enter material realm. This likely led to a process of tempering tortodrones, deconstructing them, engraving runes, imbuing with dark matter and stitching back together, and then finally sending them back to erase tortomega civilization. The idea of Undercorp targeting titans would coincide with [titans' prior experience of building castles for heavenly kingdom, adapting the myth of Asgard's creation](#fieendish-statues).

In order to understand the process and details of such tempering and arguments in favour of this theory, we need to delve into construction and the anatomy of tortodrones.

#### Anatomy of Tortodrone and Crimsonite

At first, the relation between tortodrones and crimsonite had to be addressed.

There is Crimsonite, a mineral found across Clockworks, and used to power the gates, Clockwork gates:

- `A fabled mineral of a fiery, red color said to contain the passion, anger and strength of the life surrounding it` ([Crimsonite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crimsonite#Crimsonite)).
- `A shard bomb stuffed with even more depleted Crimsonite` ([Super Shard Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Super_Shard_Bomb)), - which means that Crimsonite can be depleted through a currently unknown process.
- `A large chunk of Crimsonite primed with a potent explosive. No more depleted Crimsonite here: this bomb's made with the good stuff` ([Deadly Shard Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadly_Shard_Bomb)) - crimsonite can be depleted, which seem to suggest that its explosive power is lesser, than non-depleted. This mineral property can potentially explain the darker shade of shard missiles launched by a tortodrone, which unleash areal damage.

Tortodrones, apart from their regular active state, have a rage  state, [as depicted on mission card](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones_(Mission)>).

As shard missiles are darker and still break down to regular crimsonite shards visually, this likely is the result of them being depleted. The crimsonite is `said to contain the passion, anger and strength of the life surrounding it` ([Crimsonite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crimsonite#Crimsonite)). These shards are shot from the pistons on top of tortodrone's shell.

Based on the state of corrupted tortodrones, as they are powered by dark matter, we can guess that regular tortodrones are powered by crimsonite, evident by innate [aggro aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aggro_Aura#Aggro_Aura), one that is part of their engines, - the [power pistons](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Power_pistons) under tortodrone's shell. This means, likely both minerals - dark matter and crimsonite, are potent enough to serve as a power source.

In that sense [power pistons](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Power_pistons) serve as tortodrone's core, as they are the one device providing the aggro aura of red lightning and the source of mineral bombardment. That would suggest that shard missiles are actually weaponized unloading mechanism of depleted crimsonite used to power these constructs even in a corrupted state, despite being latter powered by dark matter.

Crimsonite is one mineral fed to drakon battle sprites. Those are remade by, supposedly, the Core into an image of [Dragons of Rage](#dragons). And, as tortodrone's red cannon - the [Grand Tortofist](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Tortofist) - deals normal damage and tortodrones are powered by crimsonite, we believe, it affirms the connection of tortodrones' power source and the crimsonite crystals, same as how dark matter crystals were used to power corrupted tortodrones.

Tortodrones, as constructs, drop [Sun Silver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Silver) which is a connection to heavens and a possible refinement of the [Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore). Both linking to a concept of heaven, but also valkyries of heavenly kingdom. It is unknown how tortomega managed to acquire this resource, although it can be speculated that it was either found, or given them   by heavenly kingdom in the end of [heavenly kingdom construction](#fiendish-statues). As the supposed tortomega are depicted in the castles' halls decorated with accessories, sun silver, refined from the celestial ore could be in that regard be used as jewelry (`An extremely rare metal of great power said to be from the heavens above. It is often completely wasted on crowns and jewelry for slime royalty` - [Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore)).

Based on corrupted tortodrones' design, it can be concluded with certainty that their shells were deconstructed and then stitched back together.

Then there are a few such locations seemingly designed to modify tortodrones with dark matter:

- [Drudgery](https://media3.spiralknights.com/wiki-images/1/1b/Scenario_Room-DevilishDrudgery_2.png)
- [Clockwork tunnels](https://media3.spiralknights.com/wiki-images/a/a1/Scenario_Room-Clockworks_18.png)
- Imagery of opened portals within the grim gates containing vials and dark matter ritual circle.
- Several location of tortodrones placed into ritual circles across Clockworks.

The stitched shell has engravings of fiendish sigils on its plates. The central top piece is replaced with dark matter. Dark matter itself, as discussed earlier, is used to power tortodrone same as crimsonite. Considering that the sigils carved in the shell do glow, it is likely that those corrupted tortodrones are in their aggravated state, which has to be red for regular tortodrones and characteristic of aggro aura.

Across sigils covering the shell all sigils are known, apart from one, which we suggested to be a link to more ancient history of Underworld. Apart from letter-based interpretation, we can also suggest it being the [sun cross](https://symbology.wiki/symbol/sun-cross/) alchemical symbol. This symbol is associated with the sun, and in astronomy, planet Earth, which follows meaning of a wheel. So far we don't have any leads for the reasoning of this sigil being placed with the rest.

Then there is [dark matter](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Shard) itself, it is likely that this is the only, if not most widespread, mineral found in the Underworld. There is a possibility of dark matter emerging due to devilite activity across realms, as a side effect of transportation, as this is the most recent mineral Spiral Order has discovered, as it mainly is used for alchemy of shadow-damaging weaponry and armor. If this mineral was as widespread as the rest, than Isorans were very likely to stumble upon it and discover shadow technology (`The Phantamos represents one of the most recent additions to the Spiral Knight's arsenal, as containing shadow energy of this degree took a great deal of research` - [Phantamos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Phantamos)).

Based on those ideas we can guess that at some point tortomega were taken advantage of, and through modification of tortodrones, which were made as weapons for their civilization, were annihilated. But, this process required capturing a tortodrone, which may be a reason why there are still many tortodrones present in across Clockworks during the Long Migration.

The nature of the migration itself does remain untold, and we can safely suggest, that this process consists of a search for the [veiled homeland](#veiled-tortodrone-homeland) of tortomega, to which Ancient Grove had to relate at some point - located in proximity of it geographically, and the rest of the landmass, as stated in the beginning - being fractured. This can be further affirmed by the animalistic motif - idea of migration patterns of tortoises, - extrapolated onto tortodrones.

#### The Titans, Tortomega, the Fall

As there are titans present both on the Clockwork gates and descriptions, the key role here, apart from mentioned [ancient titanic equipment](#symbolism-of-stone), are the titan gates.

The gates depict an entity with a single eye of familiar shape, reminiscent of Greavers' helm, holding its hands up, fixated on a sphere.

This seems to us as a most direct depiction of tortomega being related to Underworld, as there is no one working with the Underworld that close, even gremlins. During that time tortomega gained technological advancement through working with Undercorp. And that is before Undercorp sabotaged the technology, waging war on tortomega through modified tortodrones: `Investigations into the cause were inconclusive, but Spiral HQ suspects fiends are somehow involved` ([March of the Tortodrones](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones)).

At that, we believe that [Heavy Statue](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Heavy_Statue.png) and titan gates are meant to represent one single entity - a  titan, armed with Underworld technology and equipment. They have the ornament evil eye and [Troika](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Troika), a weapon suggested to belong to tortomega due to its ancient design. The further analysis will be concluded in relation to the presence of evil eye in its [own section](#evil-eye).

##### Fomorians and Irish Mythology

We will appeal to irish mythology specifically, due to its later relevance in the context of Almire. Here, we are concerned with the story of Balor - a one-eyed giant, a king of Fomorians, - malevolent civilization from the Irish Underworld. Fomorians embody forces of chaos and destruction and are at war with pantheon of deities named Tuatha De Danann.

What is important here, is that across the myths, Fomorians were ones ruling over Ireland up to a mythological Battle of Mag Tuired. This can metaphorically be applied to the Wildwoods, but this is a speculation.

The other argument is related to the single eye symbolism. As titans are depicted as cyclops, and possessing a single eye of an helm, a connection to the eye of Balor could be made here. Balor's eye symbolizes evil and destructive power, conveniently similar to the dread seal, named here as the evil eye.

#### Minerals and Souls: Part 1

As it was established, dark matter and crimsonite can be charged. This ability allows minerals be used as a _power source for Clockwork gates_, _tortodrones' operation_, and _alchemizing explosives_.

At that, luminite also can be charged, as stated: `A shard bomb formed from a small explosive encased in solar-charged Luminite` ([Sun Shards](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Shards)).

Based on shard missiles of tortodrone-derived weapons, [Savage Tortofist](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Savage_Tortofist) should be covered separately - it uses valestone in alchemy, but the color of ammo suggest it being Luminite, yellow.

This change in color, apart from being a potential design inconsistency, can be resolved through later described tendency of minerals, once charged, to change color, as suggested by other weapons:

- _Sun-charged luminite is greener_, as seen in [Sun Shards bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Shards): `A shard bomb formed from a small explosive encased in solar-charged Luminite`. Luminite is used in recipe of the [Omega Tortofist](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Tortofist).
- _Red shards of Crimsonite are not as dark in the missiles_ of [Grand Tortofist](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Tortofist), compared to the shards shot by a corrupted tortodrone. Tortodrone uses crimsonite projectiles from its core of power pistons, likely as a _weaponized mechanism of disposing depleted crimsonite_.
- _Charged dark matter is pink_, it will be covered in [case of Arkus](#arkus-the-design) and [trojans](#trojans). It will be the foundation, through which we will develop the proposed here nature of minerals in [greater detail](#minerals-and-souls-part-2-mineral-charge) as we parse through the timeline.

This might suggest that mounted or equipped cannons use charged minerals as they are remade from tortodrones' designs.

Based on this, we can conclude, that __all minerals found in the Clockworks posses an internal charge, making them applicable power source__.

During the [Heart Of Ice](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_ice), [Everfrost Tower](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Everfrost_Tower) may hint at the source of this charge. For now we have to disregard origins of Maulos. It is said that Everfrost, the tower of which very much resembles [moonstone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Minerals#Moonstone) is utilized by fiends in `large deposits of the stuff to trap the souls of the lost within it, like some kind of icy prison` ([Everfrost Tower - Recon Ranger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Everfrost_Tower)).

As moonstone and everfrost are separate materials, as well as their usage in crafting does differ, we can at least suggest, that _everfrost itself has similar properties to a mineral_, capable of being arranged into a pillar. More similarities to minerals and everfrost are found by the fact, that __everfrost is present in Maulos' back as the dark matter shard in trojans__. And only in case of Maulos everfrost is seen protruding from his skull, partially covering it. Once Maulos is defeated, __everfrost shard shatters, same as dark matter, when trojan is defeated__.

Through this connection of similar nature and themes, we will examine, what material was used to draw pale circles near Everfrost Tower and Call of the Colossi. There is also a ritual circle in the Moorcroft Manor, but it will be discussed separately in the context of [Kat Tribe](#chapter-viii-kat-tribe).

Could moonstone and minerals' originate from trapped souls as in case of everfrost? This may seem far fetched, but at the same time there is dark matter mineral is used as a food source for [Maskeraith](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith) battle sprites, making it relatively equal at least in application as other sprite food. Everfrost is unique at least for now, as it follows a theme of explicitly being tied to physics of souls. Even if we consider different cases of the cause and effect presented between trojan and dark matter, the relation is too consistent for it to be coincidence, even without introducing [Arkus](#arkus-the-design) and [other instances of dark matter](#dark-matter-as-manifestation-of-curse) to this theme. On the other hand, everfrost is used within the Underworld, by Undercorp as they went out for it, represented by Morgral'm, further playing into the earlier idea of utilitarian usage of souls or a souls-based economy.

As previously stated, all [Everfrost-related gear](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Everfrost#Usage) uses [Valestone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valestone#Valestone) in recipes (`A fabled mineral of a vibrant green color said to contain the essence of all natural life` - [Valestone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valestone#Valestone)).

Could it be that the stated `essence of all natural life` is the soul, a _lingering, utilitarian presence of a soul required to be trapped in everfrost to power the equipment_? Due to how consistent it is, there, we believe, a metaphysical explanation exists, but one we don't have full grasp so far. The idea of _an essence, a crystallized in valestone manifestation of life being sealed in everfrost though direct interaction with the souls_, seems as a solid concept on its own, but one we can not apply somewhere, apart from Apocrea.

Apocrean Realm, of course, is the other actor, which works with souls, and is seen to hunt and capture them as the [Apocrean Harvester's ability to drain souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Apocrean_Harvester). The above description, as we will discuss further, is closely similar to the idea of [Apocrean Engines](#analysis-of-apocrean-realm), as far as [Allister Danford's metaphors allow](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea): `Only souls keep these engines roaring, heard screaming across distant stars. Only souls can fill their void, sublime in its vast emptiness. Oh such beautiful souls! Bright and vibrant like fruit warming on the branch from a summer‚Äôs sun, longing for the pull of the earth below, the chance to seed and grow and birth anew`.

This theme of a _natural element being kept perpetually alive against natural laws_ was also seen in the analysis of [Snarbolax's curse](#snarbolax-and-haunting-span-classthrough-cursethrough-cursespan) and will be explored in the context of _curse's effect onto material realm_.

Here we have to acknowledge, that souls imprisoned in everfrost does not constitute them being mortal, but rather _everfrost seems as a trap, capable of intersecting with natural life-cycle of a perished creature_. That the soul should depart somewhere, rather than remain sealed by a corporate entity of Undercorp or greater Underworld.

The only place so far being close to Heaven is the heavenly kingdom, but it remains related to a literal heavenly kingdom, which we concluded to be of valkyries and their physicality, with no introduction of souls - _as if Underworld is not Hell in general, western understanding, but a mix of many interpretations. A separate, complex, self-contained dimension, - a realm with its own politics, culture and, of course, corporations_.

##### Mineral Energy and Grim Gates' Power Source

Now, while keeping those concepts in mind, one more suggestion we must present. As known ritual circles utilize some mineral in their composition - does a mineral serve as a requirement to perform the function presupposed by the pentacle?

In other world, _does the power of a mineral pentacle is drawn from the mineral itself?_

We have a few evidence of this relation to energy:

- Aforementioned internal charge of a mineral, capable enough to be used in weaponry.
- A motif not strictly magical, but both rooted in science fiction and alchemy. An energy exchange then should play a bigger role compared to [soft magic systems], and ain Spiral Knight the focus on energy is a bigger one, with the only supposedly unlimited source of energy being the Core.
- Fiendish Sigils, ones that power grim gates through unity within a fiendish ID card.

    Even if the card itself is the container for energy, for its transmutation sigils, which are depicted as essences, are still required. Burning is a form of an an energy exchange. Those material also tie to  the fiendish language itself, being partially relation to the Magical Alphabet, and at least related to the Key of Solomon the King.

With those factor, of mundane elements seemingly getting a magical property of an inner energy, seems us as a hint at the __nature of the ritual circles as ones powered by this lingering charge within minerals__.

If we take this concept further and apply to grim gates, this seems as a natural progression - one no longer required to draw and inscribe a pentacle with of a specific purpose, preemptively finding dark matter to power it. Grim gates in that regard would be a big technical advancement, where in devilite does not even required to carry dark matter, as its energy, even in different form is present within the alchemical or so magical language, contained in their sigils.

##### Rock Salt and Alchemical Primes

Apart from regular minerals, there is [Rock Salt](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Salt): `A small amount of Clockworks mineral that's been infused with absolutely nothing. It hungrily draws at nearby essences and flavors, making it a staple in cooking, and the bane of jellies everywhere`.

While it is `infused with absolutely nothing`, it is a binding element of other, similar to role of Salt in Alchemy, binding other two of 3 primes, being sulfur and mercury.

The aspect of Salt to other primes is occasionally represented as a tool to unite the opposites, and more often a representation of a physical body, while unifying property is attributed to mercury. But, based of `It hungrily draws at nearby essences and flavors, making it a staple in cooking, and the bane of jellies everywhere` we can gather that this relation is different in the setting.

To address the line `infused with absolutely nothing`, - does this mean that properties stated for the rest of minerals are far more literal, than initially guessed, infused with elements, potentially represented in [sparks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens) - Grim Spark, Primal Spark and Forge Spark?

`A small wisp of the essential spirit of technology and progress` ([Forge Spark](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens)).
-  `A small wisp of the essential spirit of darkness and decay` ([Grim Spark](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens)).
- `A small wisp of the essential spirit of nature` ([Primal Spark](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens)).

Sparks of Life in that context could represent pure energy, in also literal sense - power of a souls, which, at its core, is energy. Otherwise, this could be a coincidence. But, we believe, this connection between energy and souls remains valid due to the notion, which will be discussed in relation to [magical auras](#auras-and-souls) and [Apocrean Engines](#apocrean-engines) - of souls being used to power or to empower.

Luminite could be a stand-in for alchemical sulfur mainly through the [connection with the sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suns_in_alchemy), and not its Underworld counterpart, - [Brimstone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brimstone). As sulfur symbolizes driving force, the spirit, or the will of a living being, luminite is described as `a fabled mineral of a radiant, golden color said to contain the faith, wisdom, and zeal of the life surrounding it` ([Luminite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mineral#Luminite)), which sounds similar.

It can be argued that [Valestone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mineral#Valestone) can be an in-universe counterpart to mercury, but it does not seem to have same relation to the Sun, as suggested by [Scintillating Sun Shards](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scintillating_Sun_Shards): `A large chunk of solar-charged Luminite primed with a potent explosive`. As mercury represents consciousness, spirit, and soul, but also of a medium, which unites the opposites, and is generally accepted in medieval alchemy as such.

There are mercurial sets, such as [Mercurial Mail set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mercurial_Mail) and [Mercurial Demo set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mercurial_Demo_Suit). There aren't many leads, apart from accent on speed, similar to a concept of fluidity for the mercury in alchemy, and being made of valestone and crimsonite accordingly. The mercury, or rather quicksilver, as a substance is said to exist: `A fine set of mail made of what was once a Quicksilver` ([Quicksilver Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Quicksilver_Mail)), but, considering the context, it is more likely that quicksilver from the description is a [quicksilver lichen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Quicksilver#Quicksilver). And, as mercury is more generally accepted representation for the union of opposites across many alchemical interpretations, we might reconsider rock salt as a representation of _physical stability_ between the elements, _than a binding agent_. We will keep this distinction in mind until more elements will be revealed.
One element from the patterns found earlier we can attempt to distill. In alchemy, it was believed that minerals, through their properties correspond to spiritual aspects of the soul. And, minerals themselves possessed, in that framework, souls, which were more of a characteristics and qualities reflected in its physical properties.

Apart from those ideas, the theme of Rock Salt lacking infusion and through this attracting everything is also found in one other instance of the setting, it will be explored later.

##### Everfrost and Moonstone in Amu-Sol

Devilites use dark matter. Salt would be used only in protective, warding circles, instead of an material to bind other elements, which seem to be more fitting in the context of occultism specifically, rather than of alchemy in Underworld's presence.

The presence of everfrost is marked by ice, as seen around the Everfrost Tower and Amu-Sol. But Everfrost Tower, when discovered, is seen to be made of moonstone. _Presence of moonstone in the everfrost tower is confusing, as Maulos has distinct everfrost shard present in his back, same as other trojans have dark matter_. What is moonstone then is ambiguous.

The writings, connecting treasure boxes on the solid ground around the tower would be not of rock salt, as it has no reason to be there, unless rock salt was used to protect the encircled items, those being piles of snow and treasures. The theme of rock salt is vague, mainly due to lack of any connections apart from slime family of monsters.

And, as the entirety of the depth is covered with those writings, as if protecting the tower, we would consider them being same as ones in the Ancient Grove. But, despite this, their color is different, ever so slightly. This cold pale color is consistent across all writings found in Heart of Ice, which, we believe, frames them as an intentional design choice.

As Rock Salt is used in [Shocking Salt Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shocking_Salt_Bomb): `For nutritional purposes, this particular chunk of salt has been enriched with dangerous amounts of electricity`, and the latter has arcs of electricity, we may attempt to link it to the patterns of the writings across [Heart of Ice](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_ice) depths - intended to inspire electric motif disregarding their physical composition:

- Before Amu-Sol, [Frozen Highway](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Frozen_Highway) has those same elements used to connect Howlitzers, transforming them functionally into switches for the gates' grid.
- In [Amu-Sol](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Amu-Sol) those patters are seen near mechanical switches and buttons.

While preserving electrical motif, those writings could be either of everfrost, rock salt, or moonstone.

- Due to absence of everfrost being used in this more mundane context, we would consider the writings across Amu-Sol being of salt or moonstone.

    But, as the Everfrost Tower itself is represented to be of moonstone, and due to ongoing motif of minerals being used in writing sigils, we lean to an idea of everfrost possessing similar properties, common across all minerals and being used here for the writings.

    At the same time, everfrost itself seemingly spreads ice, as suggested by the tower, unless it is the souls which cause low temperature. This is likely wrong, as [fire souls after Lord Vanaduke's passing don't cause perpetual fires](#corporeal-body).

    Among other encounters of everfrost, [Triglav](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Triglav) is one most reminiscent of Amu-Sol's writings, as its core is exposed in pale blue light. Despite its lack of electrical motif, its [charge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Triglav_Charge_Attack.png) is most similar to cases of magic found in Amu-Sol up to icy formations.
- Rock Salt is seen in the [Pinch of Salt](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Pinch_of_Salt) at the [Research Site](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Pinch_of_Salt#Gate_Map), wherein it is depicted exactly as on the inventory icon.

    A conflict may arise here, one related to the design of [salt bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Salt_Bomb) - as it is very similar to [splinter bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadly_Splinter_Bomb) which uses luminite, but also is referred to as made of a synthetic mineral, yet capable of charge: `A large chunk of synthetic mineral primed with a potent explosive` ([splinter bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadly_Splinter_Bomb)). This can be resolved through a thought, that the bombs also attempt to use charged minerals, then, salt would change its color as seen with other minerals.

- Moonstone is seen to glow, paralleling dark matter ritual circles, and other previous examples, including Moorcroft Manor's ritual site.

    Moonstone is deeply related to electricity through the [recipes](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blue_Shard#Usage). And yet, all of its items have a much greener hue or [deep blue](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Neutralizer), compared to the color of writings found in Amu-Sol.

Due to everfrost's themes and more explored applications of moonstone, we belie an underlying logic connects the two, but, as far as designs go, specifically of Triglav, mentioned earlier, we consider writings of Amu-Sol to be made of everfrost. This would fit thematically and strengthen the connection between nature of minerals and everfrost, but won't reveal anything new. That is, if we will not uncover more similar patterns to draw parallels across.

##### Apocrean Circles

Where Underworld is present, there we expect ritual circles to be drawn. So far we have related the function of ritual circles to security and transportation. The circles are drawn with a select mineral. For Underworld it is dark matter. Earlier we have proposed a nature of the relation between properties of minerals and greater concept of a souls and energy as all being containers for this vague and omnipresent type of energy, which allows both for complex mechanisms and magic to function, - a relatively [hard magic system] of sorts.

With this, we now have to move to the Apocrean Realm and its relation to the ritual circles.

In a reveal of inner appearance of the Apocrean Realm, or its dimensional trap, as stated by the Lost Soul: `Soon you will find yourself in one of the traps set by the Apocrea. If you are powerful enough to escape then you may be able to save some of the other lost souls along the way` ([Lost Soul](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_(SotA-Haven)#Dialogue>)), there are [yellow or gold ritual circles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:SotA-Gameplay_End.png) of the [Departure](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/Departure) and [Grasping Plateau](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Grasping_Plateau) during [Shroud of Apocrea mission](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea_(Mission)), or maybe even, a literal shroud, leading into Apocrean Realm.

Those patterns have [less common shape](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:SotA-Gameplay_End.png
), yet seem to be made of seemingly known mineral of [luminite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Luminite#Luminite): `A fabled mineral of a radiant, golden color said to contain the faith, wisdom, and zeal of the life surrounding it`.

Apocrea, by being vividly inspired by eldrich entities, gods, seems to be represented as one of the first civilizations, likely preceding even Underworld, due to the tropes behind prior's inspiration. We will analyze the concrete works of fiction in detail later.

If we to take this generalized idea of eldritch beings and apply to the setting, then ritual circles would be one of the most ancient methods of using magic across the known realms.

In both ways, ritual circles could originate from Apocrean Realm, and then be adapted by Underworld to a more occult shapes similar to "The Key of Solomon the King". Or, Underworld could be one to invent those and then apply them in locations of connection to, at least, material realm, as seen in the [Departure](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Departure).

Either way, the concept would reach material realm, and, due to more notable presence of Underworld, we believe, this was done through underworld.

Then it is the nature of Apocrean ritual circles which remains unknown. Why luminite was used? Is luminite connected to the idea of [minerals defining pentacle's application and proper function](#ritual-circles-circle-of-art-pentacles) as proposed in the analysis of [fiendish glyphs](#fiendish-glyphs)?

The only idea so far we have is the idea of juxtaposing the Sun, as luminite, to darkness, one referred by, supposedly, Sleeper: `HOLD DEARLY THIS FIRE IN YOU, FOR DARKNESS WILL CONSUME ALL THE NIGHT IF ITS STARS BEGIN TO FADE` ([Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Royal_Jelly_Palace)). We will keep a more general _idea of Apocrean darkness possessing an eldritch nature_ in connection to the Sleeper in the [final analysis of the Swarm](#the-swarm).

There is a ray of light emanating from the floor surrounded by the circle, suggesting a portal, similar to the elevator exit purple portal. As for the shape of those writings, they are reminiscent of the floral, nature-inspired designs of magic belonging to [the Spirit Mother and Nature Sprites](#almire-and-spirit-mother). Could it be a further affirmation for the connection of souls to a Spirit Mother? Then, what those ritual patterns are meant to represent?

-This relation to light and protection may be also suggested by the several types of puzzles_ within the [Grasping Plateau](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Grasping_Plateau), as they play a key, helping an guiding role in solving the puzzles of the plateau.

Here a [3 layered on top of each other circles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Level_Shroud_of_the_Apocrea_puzzle_tower_gold.png) should be notes, with a bow-like curved line below them. [The same pattern is seen for its dark matter counterpart](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Devilite_Apocrea_Ritual.png), but instead of a curved line, the pattern is circled by a shape, most similar to alchemy orb, with 2 arms by its sides. We make this connection due to other appearance of the stylized pattern of the orb of alchemy - [Tomes of Rage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tome_of_Rage) contain this pattern of their cover, relating to the fundamental concept of rage. We will keep this tome in mind for [the second part of the analysis of valkyries](#chapter-viii-kat-tribe).

#### Cradle Metaphysics

Owlites, Valkyries, and Kingdom of Almire are all far more aware of elemental and shadow damage by the time we discover them. And it is while the souls don't leave material realm on Cradle, and Spiral Order with Isorans existing for eons wasn't aware of likely supernatural nature shadow nor elemental physics for [eons](#chapter-v-Isorans).

Due to this vague timeline positioning, where in the Core became a tangible gremlin-aligned force, the knowledge of those elements could not be attained by a status quo of souls returning. Unless this state is what allowed for greater manipulation of magic, compared to [Arcana](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arcana): `An exceptional handgun that fires powerful, elemental shots that many Spiral Knights refer to as 'magic missiles'`.

The events of all of the kingdoms above, even without their details are framed in a themes of phantasy, be it a lost kingdom, mythology-inspired heavenly valkyries and earthly titans, interventions of Underworld, or dark halls of a magic academy.

On the other hand there is the Core and its internal structure as completely alien to everything above, abstract.

If we consider a possibility of the Whitespace, or what it was prior to the Core, being the reason for greater magical capabilities, and if all of civilizations above do belong to this single planet, - then the property of spirits returning to material realm would be connected to all of those magical phenomena, while justifying them.

If the effects of the Core observed, as of spirits returning to material realm, exist on their own, only being manifested in cases such of the [Ghost in The Machine](#ghosts-in-the-machine), then magic does exist separately from this metaphysical condition, allowing for all of the fantasy events to happen without being tied to the Core's internal logic. This seems as moe plausible solution so far.

But, what are laws for undeath to exist? Is undeath a prime evidence of spirits returning to material realm or is it a phenomenon characteristic of magic in general? How is - `spirits return to the material realm` ([Weight of Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness)), - manifests itself on Cradle?

All of undead, devilites' work, and other supernatural phenomenon fit into the current chaotic environment of Cradle, suggesting that whatever makes souls to linger abides to the same laws. The Whitespace does contain void souls, so in other words it still allows for existence of souls in this environment. Of course, there is the aspect of the Void, which remains unknown, but, as discussed in the analysis of [minerals and souls](#minerals-and-souls-part-1), the physical foundations, the laws, remain even here.

Cradle has intersecting realms with a capacity for anyone to traverse them up to a degree. And it is confirmed by [Graveyards](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graveyards): `Graveyards are an unnatural place, a world between worlds where lost souls gather, hungry for the life of any live soul that must pass through`. That same logic can be applied to the [Candlestick Keep](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Candlestick_Keep), which itself is suspended in same obscured space, allowing for an advanced darkness, specifically not [phantoms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Phantom), but [grimalkin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grimalkin#Grimalkin) to enter to material realm in aftermath of the Kataclysm. Kataclysm will be discussed in the [analysis of Kat Tribe](#chapter-viii-kat-tribe).

So far this concept was a major element to the theory, despite being mentioned only once. We intend it to consider with all seriousness due to its implications and disclosure of the inner laws of the setting.

In the framing of the theory at that point in time we lean to the idea of spirit returning to material realm as a poetic resurging of existential threats of past civilizations - that undeath was present in the past predominantly in the relation to Underworld. We suggest this based on more peculiar items, such as [Argent Peacemaker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Argent_Peacemaker): `An ancient handgun forged from sun silver. Its bullets serve as ushers for those that refuse to leave this world` and [Cold Iron Vanquisher](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Vanquisher): `A powerful cold iron blade forged for the singular purpose of hunting down and destroying the undead`. That undeath is universal, but it does not present evidence for literal lost souls to be mentioned. If souls were to be regular part of process of life-cycle, then Spiral Order would have known of them in the modern equipment. This notion of Spiral Order not acknowledging some aspects of the setting persists across all of the setting, from which we have to make guesswork themselves and rely on the recounts of older events.

With this gathered information, we propose so far, that the __nature of Cradle's metaphysical status quo - of souls appearing outside of Underworld and Apocrean Realm is unique in its scale, but nominal in the function__ - undeath was present, but as we will see, it was deeply related to Underworld. Most of those creatures will be covered in their own chapters later:

- Undead [Howlitzers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Howlitzer) reemerging on Owlite grounds as they were [slain by Valkyries](#howlitzers-dragons-and-drakes) - either by influence of Kataclysm, or only now - due to the Core's activity.
- Past Kat Tribe [Spookats](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat) was erased by Kataclysm and then brought back in their undeath.

    The distinction between Spookats and Black Kats will be covered in their own chapter, as their are only sealed, and are brought back through summoning, reminiscent of Legion of Ur.
- Subclasses of [Zombies](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zombie) being within our theory [fallen people of Almire](#king-in-the-mountain) and other kingdoms, are suggested by influence of [Lord Vanaduke's fires](#nature-of-darkfire), as Legions of Almire. To them we attribute [Almirian Crusaders](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_Crusader) and [Dreadnoughts](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadnaught) as of similar [skeletal design](#undead-dreadnoughts).
- Lastly, [Scarabs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scarab) have a link to death, most evident by their name and ribcage shell. This motif of death and insect-like design reminds us of [inhabitants of Apocrean Realm](#analysis-of-apocrean-realm).

But here, undeath presents itself from every case of death in proximity to Cradle, _without a need for an explicit action of curse or induced by it transformation_. Prime example of it being, if we commit to the idea of Spiral Order being unaware of souls, by the result of [ghost in the machine danger mission](#ghosts-in-the-machine).

Lastly, the we are yet to identify the time period of both [western-themed handguns](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Antigua) and [corresponding armor sets](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gunslinger_Sash) to be identified, as well as of the [Cold Iron Vanquisher](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Vanquisher), as they may stir in the correct direction the initial proposal described above.

##### Consoles: Part 1 - Gremlin Containments and Consoles

We believe, that _gremlins guard the Firestorm Citadel at the [Gauntlet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gauntlet)_ with modern devices and traps.

Gauntlet's second depth is of deconstruction zone with a nontrivial name - "Reign of Fire", and the last depth - the ["Last Stand"](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Gauntlet/Last_Stand) with an architecture of the Scarlet Fortress, always has gremlins present at the final arena, accompanied by elite constructs and elemental fiery gun puppies.

Overall, this does not seem as a coincidence, but a pattern, also seen in the [Ghost in The Machine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghosts_in_the_Machine) danger mission, discussed in the [its analysis section](#ghosts-in-the-machine) in the [context of lasers and battlepods](#battlepods-and-laser-technology).

Firestorm Citadel has itself a dedicated room with a mysterious console embedded behind the throne room, which does not seem accessible from the outside of the molten cavern, as the rest of the citadel is protected by Lord Vanaduke. Due to this, Citadel became a significant element of rank missions, as it blocked further access to the Core: `The Core was in sight. But now some kind of massive negative energy anomaly has surfaced above the Core, blocking access to it. Recon Knights have said that all they see near it is fire, endless fire` ([Ending in Fire - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ending_in_Fire)).

Does that mean, that the console and Clockworks were already present before [kingdom of Almire had fallen](#king-in-the-mountain)? Same logic can be applied to the Royal Jelly Palace, as the artifact console is also present there, embedded into the stonework floor behind throne room. This pattern of being hidden behind the throne room is notable, and we will return to it.

Here, we must keep in mind, that Royal Jelly Palace belongs to the main structure of the Scarlet Fortress, and, by extension, heavenly kingdom, as discussed in the [heavenly kingdom chapter](#chapter-iv-valkyries-of-heavenly-kingdom).

Consoles' design is very similar to Clockwork elevators - _its holographic monitor panel's sides have practically identical design to Clockwork Elevator side panels_ of __3 short cylinders extending from the edges in radial manner__, _a characteristic element of gremlin technology across Clockworks_. Moreover, the [runes present on the mysterious console and artifact seem to be the same as on the Roarmulus Twins' armor plates](#gremlin-conlang). This language of gremlins will be covered in the [gremlin conlang section](#gremlin-conlang).

This makes it seem that these consoles were strategically placed into those appropriate locations. Yet, the time period remains undefined, - when those consoles were build? And why, [apart from controlling Core's hatch](#artifact-console-and-a-hatch)?

The console of [Shadowplay](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay) is unlikely to be placed in the Citadel after it had burned. Royal Jelly Palace was overtaken by jellies, which also represents an alien danger to gremlins. On the contrary, could it be that this exact danger was the reason for such placement? __There is a motif of monarchy, of throne rooms, and castles of past civilization serving as keystone locations to access the Core__. This motif could be further connected to the myth of gremlin king Tinkinzar, weather he exists or not, as if the console's purpose went beyond a single kingdom, _using it as a strong foundation for whatever is to be built_. We see it as an interpretation of the motif of a "king of kings". It will be explored further in the context of gremlins in [their chapter](#chapter-ix-gremlin-empire).

At the same time, we'll relate to an earlier proposal, one that postulates that the Core, or rather the Whitespace present in material realm, is responsible for the lingering of the curse and interconnection of Underworld with material realm, as well as an ability for spirits to return.

First console was placed into one the citadels of Almire, and the other console within valkyrian halls of the scarlet fortress. This would make gremlins, if they were builders of the Clockworks during reign of those kingdoms, as one of more ancient civilizations.

But, this would lead for the Core and Cradle to exist during those civilization, which seems unlikely solely by the fact of Clockworks not being mentioned at all. As we have considered [castles' history earlier](#castles), this placement would seem accurate for consoles to be protected, suggesting that gremlins were building Clockworks or at least introduced those consoles to those civilizations with the Core already requiring such security measures, evident by consoles' sophisticated function and design.

And, if the consoles were installed later, as the civilizations in charge of these castles disappeared, gremlins would have ability to traverse those environments - likely still empty Royal Jelly Palace, but already burning Firestorm Citadel.

As for Herex in the context of Shadowplay and current proposal, we will discuss him during the analysis of the [exact mechanics of the Artifact](#artifact-console-and-a-hatch), but here, taken our later analysis of his actions, we lean to an idea of him entering the citadel after knights have defeated Lord Vanaduke solely due to lesser risk of the environment, compared to its still burning state. And that is taking in account, that Herex seemingly arrived with a small army of gremlins into the Citadel. This will be also discussed in the [chapter on gremlins](#chapter-ix-gremlin-empire).

Another question is of elevators within Scarlet Fortress, Royal Jelly Palace, and Firestorm Citadel being diegetic. That is, are they present in the historical context of those locations? Within current framework they are, and have dedicated icons from gremlins themselves to navigate through. This would likely mean, that gremlins at least in the past had ability to handle those environments and use them to secure the consoles.

If we consider previous suggestion of the console being installed later, as the citadel was burning, while allowing for Herex's traversal, we could explain it by the sheer manpower of gremlins during, seemingly, [more stable period of time](#gremlin-military-industrial-complex), while Clockworks were still under construction, - also explored in [later chapters](#chapter-ix-gremlin-empire).

This arrangement of events indeed seems absurd, as it _contradicts the framed narrative of the Citadel as an impenetrable and eternal cursed fortress_, but, so far, it is the only plausible explanation for presence of high-tech equipment within its medieval setting without creating a sequence, where gremlins, and by proxy the Core, were present during reign of both civilizations, separated by thousand years.

#### Evil Eye

Across Cradle there is a perpetual, yet subtle presence of an eye, mainly recognized in its 2 distinct designs:

- One we were referring as an antique design, seen, for example, on Heavy statues and Graviton Bombs.
- The other is featureless, most commonly associated with the Shadow Lairs and curse, also found on Sealed Sword 4 and 5-star upgrades.

Throughout this document we were referring to both instances collectively as an evil eye in order to distinguish this motif.

This design stems from Underworld, and meant to represent its presence in material realm. As we have discussed earlier in the [analysis of Undercorp's initial advancements](#undercorps-initial-advancements), the symbol originates from fiendish wildlife, seemingly used in Underworld's army. The evil eye design first appeared within [greavers' helms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greaver), and later applied to tortodrone shells, in similar manner as it was present on Greavers' wings being attributed to its natural for the Underworld presence, as tortodrones were build by tortomega through assistance of Undercorp.

We propose, that the latter, antique instance of an evil eye is the result of the collision of cultures - introduction of Underworld and its occult physicality to titans' civilization, their mixing, and integration of fiendish evil eye into titans' designs during active development of the latter.

As a potential sign of this connection with the Underworld, this transition was depicted in [Heavy Statues](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Heavy_Statue.png), when titans were still using the heavy cleaver weapons such as [Troika](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Troika). To this ancient-colored theme we have approached several times from different points of view.

Why heavy statues have ears similar to fiend enemy symbol? Our guess is is use usage of the greavers' helm, adapter for draconic, or rather, tortoise-like anatomy of titans. And despite this, the design itself had remained the same, as it has essential to it elements, as devilite ears, and, of course, the eye.

Once devilite and titan cultures were connected, they transferred a different mythology, one that was present in Underworld as seen in, again, greavers' helms, a depiction of eye. This depiction of titans, armored in Underworld equipment, but related to stone, had to be seen by gremlins in order to construct gates with their imagery. Moreover, we can identify the precise details of this supposed Underworld armor.

This might be a lead to a greater presence of cyclopean entities with a single eye. From those mythological entities the single-eyed helm could've been designed. On par with it, there is a theme of transformation - embodied by gorgos, notably, with a single eye. [Gorgo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgo) are already referred in the [Gorgofist](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgofist): `A terrifying handgun that combines the dual-crushing power of a gorgo and the mythical tortomega`.

If we are to take this ide even further the single eye design with a jagged mouth below - a feature of gorgos, is also found far later into the timeline and will be properly attributed - the Collector has the same feature-rich design, comprised of an antique eye and a painted spiked mouth.

This persisting over the ages motif seems intentional.

##### Grim Totems: Part 1

This eye symbolism may be related to a more general anatomical themes of Underworld, specifically, existence of grim totems. Grim totems will be later analyzed in the context of Almire. As for now, both scenarios of totems being introduced with Undercorp or later fit to the timeline at that point in time.

But, one concept worth mentioning here is the potential relation of grim totems to the [state of Cradle as allowing for spirits to return into material realm](#cradle-metaphysics).

We believe this connection exists, solely due to a unique resurrection property of totems and undead Dreadnoughts. Commonly a resurrection of a an already perished creature, already being undead would account for its soul finally leaving from a corpse to be tethered back to the corporeal body. This is similar to the general notion of lost souls appearing across Cradle, and now we observe, that Underworld is at least capable of such manipulations with the lingering in spirit. But, furtehr analysis, such as explanation of lack of heat in ressurected instances requires a deeper dive into the nature of grim totems.

##### Monster Doors

The other seemingly soul-related concept is tied to the [Monster Doors](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Monster_Door.png).

If devilites did work with gremlins, then monster doors would have a high possibility of belonging to them. The door has the same anatomical, facial design with a familiar lightning arcs, which will be later discussed in the [context of trojans](#legion-of-ur). The idea of gates deactivating when no enemies are present, and attributed as such to a generic evil design, can have a meaning befitting to Underworld.

Existence of souls, their acknowledgement, as well as later themes regarding capabilities of soul-manipulation may point to a soul-based operation of Underworld devices. As there was a [framework of energy and minerals being related, as souls did provide a potential source of energy through them](#minerals-and-souls-part-1), the possibilities of other diegetic designs does exist. And, in this approach monster doors seem as valid devices, as grim totems.

##### Nefarious Imp

As returning to the topic of the evil eye, its symbolism within Underworld and previously mentioned topic of Underworld armor, we have a figurehead, which connects those themes, as well as introduces some clarity for the reasons, why Undercorp would expand into material realm. This entity is the Nefarious Imp.

Nefarious imp is directly mentioned in the armor-costume set, comprised of the [Nefarious Raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nefarious_Raiment) and a [Nefarious Hood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nefarious_Hood). The latter has the _evil eye incorporated in the most advanced manner ever witnessed_, looking seemingly the same as evil eye in [Gran faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gran_faust), with trident-like marks to the sides of an eye. Those marks are present on the hilt of Gran Faust: `an upgraded Faust forged from pristine-quality shadow steel` ([Gran faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gran_faust)) forged in the Underworld (`A powerful, cursed sword forged in the underworld.` [Faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Faust)).

And, based on both recipe and context, [Shadow Steel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadow_Steel): `An extraordinary metal imbued with the creeping darkness of the Underworld` seems as a prime material for this fiendish alchemy, being an antithesis of the divine themes of [Sun Silver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_silver): `An extraordinary metal imbued with the radiant light of the sky`. And, based on its purple color as well as many shadow related technology, the steel itself is purple. Weather it is related to dark matter - is unknown, but we wager those are connected, as we will see in the [analysis of metals, imbued with elemental magic](#volcanic-elements).

Ths metallic, lined design is also found on the [Wicked Idol](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wicked_Idol). We have previously proposed in the [analysis of Apocrean Circles](#apocrean-circles), that the darkness of Underworld or even Apocrea is the same darkness Sleeper was referring to. Here we have another instance of darkness referred to as a metaphysical presence. Shadow steel is described as `An extraordinary metal imbued with the creeping darkness of the Underworld`. While we will not commit to this concept, its peculiarity - its themes, framing of darkness is something to remember.

The symbol of 3 lines extending from an eye with a circular dots is reminiscent of _Alphabet of Magic_ from "The Key of Solomon thr King", specifically one of its inspirations, the _Malachim Alphabet_. By designs it is meant to resemble constellations, and often this family of magical systems, which had influenced the script in the Key, is believe to be deeply related to the _Sacred Geometry_. The symbol in question is most similar to the letter Aleph. Yet, further connections of this symbolism within the cosmology, remains unknown.

Furthermore, this connection of Nefarious imp to curse is affirmed by the description of the [Wicked Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wicked_Prize_Box) - [Something Wicked This Way Comes](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/110021): `Today Spiral HQ introduces a line of gear that should help you blend into environs riddled with cursed monsters. We bring these to you in the Wicked Prize Box, with contents including the following: Wicked helms, Wicked armors, Wicked accessories, Crest of Curse (new), Nefarious Hood (new), Nefarious Raiment (new)`.

##### Arctic Plot

The designs of this set may suggest that this Imp was one most connected with the evil eye designs of Underworld, as evident by [Greavers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greaver) unique armor. The hood, on the other hand, is reminiscent of Apocrean cultists' [obsidian hoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Hood_of_Rituals).

The description of [Nefarious Hood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nefarious_Hood) states: `The floating hood is certain to cloak you during clandestine campaigns`, - the `clandestine campaigns` is similar to one of [Arctic Rogue Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arctic_Rogue_Mask): `The shattered ice will conceal your identity during clandestine arctic expeditions`. The arctic set is part of [Glacial Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Glacial_Prize_Box).

This is a part of [Arctic Rogue Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arctic_Rogue_Mail) which also has evil eye symbol on its belt. With this armor comes the [Arctic Acolyte Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arctic_Acolyte_Mantle) and [Arctic Acolyte Hood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arctic_Acolyte_Hood) which are possibly connected to the Apocrea: `A hood said to be worn by wandering arctic acolytes. 'we saw them heading straight towards the mountains, off into the interior of the vast frozen continent, but why?'`

The Apocrea, being an eldrich realm in that arctic context fits the fabula of ["At the Mountains Of Madness"](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/At_the_Mountains_of_Madness), which will be discussed at the [Apocrean Engines section](#apocrean-engines), but currently we need to keep in mind a general eldritch cosmic entities' motif.

This Arctic expedition could be a reason for [Maulos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maulos#Maulos) to exist, as it was likely summoned as a trojan, in the same manner as the rest of the [Legion of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur).

To continue this notion, Amu-Sol, as described in the [Heart of Ice](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_ice) briefing: `Freak snowstorms and blizzards have begun surging through the depths seeming to originate from an inhospitable, fiendish city known as 'Amu-Sol'`, may be a stand-in for the eldrich city in Antarctica from "At the Mountains of Madness", although this is likely a coincidence. The key element here being the city was uninhabited before the events, so, this seems fitting to a more general notion of some events being happening in regards to the Underworld and Undercorp.

Despite this intermissions, overall setting would suggest that the Nefarious Imp had to be aware of Heart of Ice plot, and, considering his armor, his knowledge of the Curse and wielding of shadow steel, and possibly, Gran Faust - considering their closely similar designs, - it would be plausible for this plan to be carried out by the rogue devilites of Undercorp, as they were becoming everfrost fanatics, but orchestrated by the Imp.

If we are to apply corporate setting, this dichotomy makes us think of Undercorp as by itself a large, desynchronized to a degree corporate entity, which still takes action to enter material realm in many different directions.

The act of bringing back Maulos could also be a continuation of the same methodology of bringing back trojans from Underworld through the usage of ritual circles. And, as it was discussed earlier in relation to the function of ritual circles, the process was too slow to bring back entire legion of Ur onto Cradle. A possible solution could be to empower a few trojans with the same underlying curse that afflicted Vanaduke, that is through unnamed Hail Deity - one discussed earlier in the [Maulos section](#influences-of-underworld). But, as this theme so far seem to have no proven physical foundation, we will return to it in the direct analysis of the [legion of Ur and trojan physiology](#legion-of-ur).

The [Arctic Acolyte Set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arctic_Acolyte_Mantle): `we saw them heading straight towards the mountains, off into the interior of the vast frozen continent` links acolytes of Apocrean design with the story of ["At the Mountains of Madness"](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/At_the_Mountains_of_Madness), which contains one of the possible locations for an inter-dimensional [Plateau of Leng](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Plateau_of_Leng), which is similar to [the Grasping Plateau](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Grasping_Plateau), with both housing a powerful cloaked figure: on Cradle it is Apocrean Harvester, and within Leng its [the High Priest](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/High_Priest_Not_to_Be_Described), another eldrich entity, likely being a nod to the more eldritch interpretation of the Yellow King. This interpretation of the Yellow King is modern version, different from the mostly a concept of the king from Robert Chamber's "The King in Yellow". Here, we believe, a work is being done on the __eldritch/outer god interpretation of the Yellow King of post-Lovecraftian popular culture and perception of this type of fiction__, _rather than a Yellow King from the source material_, upon which the latter would be built.

Apart from it, Scarabs and Lovecraftian influence could point to another theme across Lovecraftian Mythos, specifically, the [Nameless City](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Nameless_City) in the desert, and [short story "Nyarlathotep"](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Nyarlathotep_(short_story)), as well as ["The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath"](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dream-Quest_of_Unknown_Kadath) which contain themes of Ancient Egypt, as Nyarlathotep is depicted often as a pharaoh in black and gold. This egyptian motif is vaguely observed across Underworld's culture, as it takes many inspirations from those regions.

Due to those parallels, we may suggest, __due to cunning nature and scheming themes of both Nyarlathotep and Nefarious Imp, the latter seems to be a stand-in of the prior in this cosmology__.

Nefarious Imp will be later addressed in the [Moorcroft manor past the heavenly kingdom section](#moorcroft-manor-past-heavenly-kingdom) in relation to Underworld expansion and then resolved in the [Resurrection of Margrel](#margrel-and-immortality-through-curse), further relation to this idea of Imp targeting Cradle.

While the next connection is likely a coincidence, we have to point out mention of citadels, as if in potential relation to Almire, as a kingdom, [closely associated with the Spirit Mother](#almire-and-spirit-mother):

<BookCitation source="H. P. Lovecraft - Fungi from Yuggoth, XXI. Nyarlathotep">
  {#snippet markup()}

  XXI. Nyarlathotep

  And at the last from inner Egypt came

  The strange dark One to whom the fellahs bowed;

  Silent and lean and cryptically proud,

  And wrapped in fabrics red as sunset flame.

  Throngs pressed around, frantic for his commands,

  But leaving, could not tell what they had heard;

  While through the nations spread the awestruck word

  That wild beasts followed him and licked his hands.

  Soon from the sea a noxious birth began;

  Forgotten lands with weedy spires of gold;

  The ground was cleft, and mad auroras rolled

  Down on the quaking citadels of man.

  Then, crushing what he chanced to mould in play,

  The idiot Chaos blew Earth‚Äôs dust away.

  {/snippet}
</BookCitation>

##### Operation Gelid and other methods of escaping Cradle

At the same time, presence of Spiral Knights' armor within the [Glacial Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Glacial_Prize_Box) roster might suggest that Imp could be involved though the design similarities to the apocrean gear. Those being:

- `A plated robe said to be worn by wandering arctic acolytes. 'we saw them heading straight towards the mountains, off into the interior of the vast frozen continent, but why?'` ([Arctic Acolyte Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arctic_Acolyte_Mantle)).
- `A hood said to be worn by wandering arctic acolytes. 'we saw them heading straight towards the mountains, off into the interior of the vast frozen continent, but why?'` ([Arctic Acolyte Hood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arctic_Acolyte_Hood)).

Notably, in the [forum post](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/107155), which is an in-universe email, it is said that `Spiral HQ has embarked upon OPERATION GELID. An assortment of items are available to you, including the following`, which in the above context might mean that Spiral HQ itself has an undisclosed relation to Underworld and Apocrea, possibly resulting in the events of [Heart of Ice](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_ice), as there had to be a reason behind this arctic expedition.

Considering that at that point in time the only goal of Spiral Order was to field energy source and leave Cradle, and the totality of many discoveries of Spiral Order in relation to elemental and shadow damage, Spiral HQ could be planning for other scenarios. We suggest it due to presence of those aforementioned arctic cultist armors on the prize box itself, as, if they are diegetic to the contents of the box, Spiral HQ had to be aware of them.

#### Strangers and Haven

Strangers are one of more illusive civilizations on Cradle despite direct interaction of Isorans with them during the aftermath of Skylark crash landing.

In order to understand them, we will start from their currently known town, Haven.

Haven itself is a rather unique location. It is a small town seemingly built on the slope of a mountain. Inside the mountain is the Arcade - a large Clockwork terminal with an access to the Clockwork gates, whose pathways eventually converge at the Core Terminal. We can suggest the Arcade being inside of the mountain based on the goal of Project Roarmulus - `Project R appears to be in fact two massive weapons known as the 'Roarmulus Twins.' Designed by one of the Crimson Order itself, the Roarmulus Twins are some kind of construct cannon that the gremlins intend on moving up the Clockworks into the Haven Arcade! Based on what the schematics suggest, their power far exceeds standard gremlin weaponry and could be truly devastating to Haven, Spiral HQ and the strangers should it reach the Arcade.` ([Target Acquired - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Target_Acquired)), - meaning, that entirety of Haven is vulnerable from the Arcade, so it is relatively close to Clockworks proper, rather than Cradle's crusts.

While this a different topic, the fact rotating through the Arcade gates pass through the same terminals, may suggest that other Arcade surface Terminals exist, which have their own sets of depth-fixed Clockwork Terminal. As for the Core Terminal - [we will discuss it](#core-terminal) far later into the timeline, as it differs greatly int its design and purpose.

Haven is surrounded by a brick wall, with a central entrance guarded by a sliding mechanical gates, identified by a gear track and a gear itself, seemingly serving as a large vault door.

Below main entrance to Haven a large chasm with a set of Clockwork tunnels containing [Razwog's power complex facility is located](#artifact-console-and-a-hatch). We will keep this placement in mind for the analysis of gremlins.

##### Guild Hall and Spiral Order Headquarters

On the east side of the town square there are the Lab and Guild Hall. Now, considering size of Haven, we suggest that the guild hall canonically contains the Spiral Headquarters, as the building itself seem to be a mechanical, fortified 3-story structure with ribbed walls and small horizontal windows. Notably, its underground level seems to be located within a small cavern within the same mountain as the Arcade, with rooms suspended above the Clockworks.

Ribbed walls are designed to enhance structural integrity. A partially upgraded guild hall has at its central section a large table with, supposedly, Skylark equipment, same as in the Lab in form of the secondary generator. Judging by the room itself, _it seems likely that it is the briefing room of Spiral Order Headquarters_. The [general outline depicted within the Lab](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Biscotti_Alchemy_Machine.png) above the [food alchemy machine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sprite_Food_Alchemy_Machine), considering Lab's location, likely points to the inner layout of a fully upgraded Guild Hall, as evident by presence of the aforementioned room as well as visible wings of the hall on the map.

##### Haven Lab

The Lab, while it contains an on-site Isoran research facility, seems also to have an underground level. We make such guess based on 2 elements:

- An unlit pit below the secondary Skylark reactor and an empty space around and below the room where Artifact was held
- The mechanical, Clockwork tunnels-like design and the events of [A New Threat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_New_Threat/Lobby). (`we're starting to get an alarming number of reports of gremlins mobilizing in the Clockworks below Haven` - [Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_New_Threat/Lobby)) suggest that the lower layers of the Lab are directly connected to the tunnels below.
- Haven has a location of exposed metal-plated floor similar to the Rescue Camp. The latter case has a direct exposed pit, while in Haven the place being the forge with Vise and Punch located there. Considering the earlier argument of a direct connection to clockwork tunnels, due to this pattern, such proposal seems to us as relatively plausible.

##### Culture of Strangers

On the west side of Haven there is the bazaar. Considering how small the town is, and how geographically isolated it is between a mountain and a chasm, yet accessible from the Clockworks, we suggest that there are likely another similar to Haven, trade-oriented towns, with a population of Strangers built around Arcade-like Clockwork Terminals in an established network of trading routes.

The trading aspect can be inspected closer - that is the design behind Strangers and their culture.

First of, they seem to live in an lush warm area near the mountain range. The town, apart from the town square is decorated with canopy of designed with patterns fabric cloths hung between of near buildings' walls. The material from which houses are built, are more ofter white, simplistic, occasionally spiral, stoneworks and masonry, or Clockwork metalwork, seemingly used in more secured areas, such as the Lab or auction house on the town square. Buildings are usually not higher than 2 stories, with a few sparsely placed water pools.

Then there are Strangers' designs of tall figures, obscured by long-sleeved cloaks and brimmed hats with masks. Strangers usually have an inventory equipped, seemingly protected from the environment as judged by the cloth placed on top of it. To make accent on masks, gremlins [Punch](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Punch) and [Vise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vise), who also have masks of this similar design with one eye being a horizontal slit, although not glowing as the other eye of Strangers' helms.

This makes us think of a region with a warm, possibly dry climate, and, while not explicitly, a nomadic, resourceful culture. This may be a fitting design, as for the location of Haven - it is surrounded by large clusters of revealed Clockworks.

We can suggest that Cradle at that point in time is still being built, although there is an instance of revealed to the surface Clockwork depths being a location of [planetary defenses](#cradle-defenses), we will keep it in mind, as it was the reason behind Skylark crash landing.

Semi-nomadic lifestyle of Stranger in that sense can be attributed to a risk of Cradle incorporating more matter to its surface, so this might lead to nearby population centers to embark through arcade and underlying clockwork tunnels to a different location. Those inspirations might have been considered, due to disclosed inspiration behind Haven: `Haven's original look resembled something similar to a Ald'ruhn from The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind. As you might imagine, it really didn't look right` ([10 things you didn't know about Spiral Knights](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/20773)).

Outside of Haven there is a [graveyard](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blades_of_the_Fallen), which contains the first instance of Lost Souls. This graveyard differs drastically from the rest of graveyards, as it is characterized by a field fo revered arms, a military funeral, most certainly attributed to Spiral Order. Yet, the fact lost souls to persist there, we link to the [same phenomenon as Isorans of the Iron Hulk during Ghost in The Machine danger mission](#ghosts-in-the-machine).

##### Minerals and Souls: Part 2 - Strangers' Mining Operations, Crystal and Mist Energy

Strangers are known to perform mining operations in proximity of Haven, evident by [Greave's outfit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greave) and roster of items, particularly:

- `A sturdy, old helmet once used to dig for precious minerals. It offers a little more defense than a Spiral Helm` ([Mining Hat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mining_Hat)).
- `A strange helm with a single, focused eye favored by junior gunners` ([Cyclop's Cap](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cyclops_Cap)).
- `A sturdy shovel modified to dole out a little extra damage to slime family monsters` ([Slime Slasher](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slime_Slasher)).
- `It was suggested that this brutally sharp mining pick could probably be used to hunt both beasts AND minerals. The Clockworks were never the same` ([Big Beast Basher](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Big_Beast_Basher)).

Given mine railing in the Arcade, as well as a few storages of minerals, including mineral pillars, we can assume, that Strangers were performing mining operations near the Arcade. The same containers, as ones seen near minerals, are carrier across Haven by, now, knight of Spiral Order.

In this context of exploration done by Strangers, we believe, lockdown maps are to be attributed to those areas. Most of those maps have regular Clockwork designs, implying their position below the ground in a similar manner to Guild Hall and Lab being located within the mountain and going below it. While we won't list all of those maps, as those are redundant, several instances expand on earlier established concepts:

- There are Mines, which incorporate stoney surface landscape above Clockwork walls in similar design to the Arcade, implying its position as a cavern.
- The Reactor and Facility have Clockwork tunnels' designs, but given its name, and position as an arena, we can assume that this is Haven's energy production plant.
- The Furnace serves the same function as Clockworks' Blast Furnaces, with a difference of the lockdown map having a burning cavern underneath it. The design of the floor is identical to the cavern of later explored Firestorm Citadel. But, given the context, we a leaning to the ide of this place related to Strangers' mining operations, specifically for smelting.
- Rampants, while unrelated to Haven, further expand on the Scarlet Fortress in its design.

As for the mining material themselves, we can suggest them being the minerals, potentially connecting to reasons for a presence of the devilites of the coliseum, including king Krogmo himself, as most reminiscent of a devilite in his anatomy.

Another suggestion, which further ties with the nature of energy, mentioned this time on the wiki by Cory, states: `Shortly after the Spiral Knights landed upon Cradle, scouting teams reported an intense energy signal coming from the planet‚Äôs core, and now the Knights have been tasked with investigating in the hopes that this energy can be used to power their ship. The Clockworks and most every machine the knights encounter run on energy, including their own power armor. All knight armor is equipped with a device that is able to constantly pull energy from the air; known as ‚Äòmist,‚Äô into their armor, allowing them to function and power up machinery they encounter. However, mist dissipates almost as quickly as it is acquired, and thus a knight‚Äôs mist energy can never be permanently stored. However, the Strangers that run Haven have long been mining various parts of the Clockworks for pure, crystallized energy and like everything in their possession, it is for sale. This crystallized energy is much more stable and can last forever in a knights reserve tank, inside their armor ... Due to the intense power source at Cradle's core, the entire planet's atmosphere is imbued with loose, airborne mist energy ... Each Spiral Knight will constantly absorb this mist energy ... The Strangers operate an elaborate mining system in order to retrieve and harness the crystallized energy that occurs at great depths, beneath the planet's crust` ([Crystal Energy - Lore - Cory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/index.php?title=Energy&oldid=20)).

This, essentially, __allows for an existence of a unified term of energy, identified in the Mist Energy and Crystal Energy__, the one we have proposed to exist [earlier](). Yet, we don't have evidense of minerals, despite them containing energy, to be equal as medium to Crystal Energy or Fire Crystals: `We need to analyze how mineral power affects the Core. The problem is that very little power reaches down to these depths. We can gather so much data from each gate as it launches`, as specified by the technicial left of Vaelyn at the Core Terminal.

At that, the description of `Due to the intense power source at Cradle's core, the entire planet's atmosphere is imbued with loose, airborne mist energy` is very similar to one of [Static Clinger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Clinger): `A latent strand of energy that floats throughout the Clockworks, frequently catching onto hair and clothing. It's too large to properly distill into Energy, but it's very useful in alchemy`.

Given those factors, we believe, the __glowing energy symbol found across Spiral Order armors is the mist energy collector or tank__.

Notably, it is through the bribe several [Bombhead Masks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Bombhead_Mask): `A mask commissioned by King Krogmo to celebrate the launch of Blast Network that curiously resembles a live bomb. Available in a wide variety of styles, there is likely one to match any armor set`, can be acquired, including a [Cursed Bombhead Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Cursed_Bombhead_Mask-Equipped.png). Due to its design and acknowledgement of curse, it reminds us of [undead Bombies](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Bombie). Could it be, that those masks are manufactured in the same manner, as zombies are transformed after their death into bombies? As there are devilites present, even if their are not seemingly affiliated with Undercorp, we have to keep in mind their presence.

##### Cradle Festivals

There are a few celebrations in Haven, attributed to Strangers' culture:

- `The Dark Harvest Festival is now being celebrated in Haven and will end on November 1st! This annual event honors the mischievous Punkin King in order to ensure a healthy fall harvest for Haven. All Clockwork Tunnels-style levels like Power Complexes and Blast Furnaces now have a chance of featuring special rooms inhabited by the Punkin King. Simply hop on the party pad and discover if the Punkin King has candy tokens or something else in store for you!` ([The Dark Harvest Festival](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/66484)) - [Dark harvest](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Dark_Harvest)
- `The Strangers pause at the equinox to recognize the brief moment of cosmic balance on Cradle. For just a breath of time, there is harmony between night and day, the sun and moon, and symmetry in the celestial sphere` ([Balance of the Equinox](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/98178), [Cradle Equinox](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Equinox_Prize_Box)).
- Not particularly and event, but a tendency of [Shroud of the Apocrea](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea) resurging over Cradle annually.

Earlier we have discussed meaning of several [Equinox Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Equinox_Prize_Box) items, and how they are unique in 2 attributes: they are from Isoran past, and how alchemical meaning is weaved into them. Strangers being capable of recognizing this property would mean that in their own culture relatively similar cosmological and mythological concepts exist.

In this relation to Strangers' culture, Dark Harvest festival is of greater interest to us: `Strangers of Haven pay tribute to a peculiar spirit known as the 'Punkin King' in order to ensure a healthy fall harvest` ([The Dark Harvest](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Dark_Harvest)). We suggest it being a more celtic side to Strangers' culture, and, with the earlier nomadic theme, this furthermore demonstrates merging of multiple concepts and themes present across the setting. The presence of the spirit of Pumpkin King itself, it seems to us, as if the metaphysics of the spirits returning to material realm had allowed for Strangers to perform the Dark Harvest as it is depicted so far. Weather this festival had existed before Strangers met Cradle is unknown.

#### Analysis of Apocrean Realm

Cradle has a connection to the Underworld, in, at least, 2 instances:

- First, there were tortomega, who stumbled upon Undercorp as the latter entered material realm, explored in [Arrival of Undercorp](#chapter-vi-arrival-of-undercorp),
- Second, there are gremlins, who are reported to outsource development of projects against Spiral Knights: `Analysis of the data collected from these offices indicates that devilite corporations are outsourced by gremlins in order to design and manage various projects that include weapons specifically engineered to target Spiral Knight squads` ([Work for Idle Hands](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Work_for_Idle_Hands)).

Apocrean Realm, on the other hand, remains unexplored. There is a hint to understanding its logic found in [Professor Allister Danford's journal entry](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276): `Only souls keep these engines roaring, heard screaming across distant stars. Only souls can fill their void, sublime in its vast emptiness. Oh such beautiful souls! Bright and vibrant like fruit warming on the branch from a summer's sun, longing for the pull of the earth below, the chance to seed and grow and birth anew` as well as `The Apocrea are ... a terrible legion of otherworldly phantasms whose only ambition seems to be trapping and devouring the souls of all life` ([Obsidian Nexus - Lost Soul](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Obsidian_Nexus)).

As there are souls to be freed across the [Grasping Plateau](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Grasping_Plateau), which are kept seal by [Apocrean Sigils](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Apocrean_Sigil#Apocrean_Sigil): `An otherworldly brand placed upon a soul claimed by the mysterious Apocrea. Removing it allows the captured soul to escape imprisonment within the terrible realm of the Apocrea`, we can draw parallels everfrost's capacity to contain souls.s

Grasping plateau itself, we believe, is nod to [plateau of Leng](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Plateau_of_Leng). This is not much, but, as in exploration of Plateau of Leng, there was a hooded figure, derived of the King in Yellow, Apocrean Harvester could be of similar inspiration. More so, Plateau of Leng is supposedly located at a crossing point of multiple dimensions, which is not an exact, but similar theme to Grasping Plateau being a trap or located in proximity of material realm.

As those notions are rooted in lovecraftian horror thematically, Danford's text are in this genre are most confidently are truthful. This text seem to pinpoint exact motivations of Apocrea: that __the souls are the resource by which Apocrean Realm is sustained__ and is motivated to reach out into material realm, essentially, for [the energy contained as the souls](#auras-and-souls).

Allister Danford in the context of eldritch horror themes likely represent a similar figure, [Danforth](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Danforth) of the events of ["In the Mountains Of Madness"](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/At_the_Mountains_of_Madness), where Plateau of Leng was supposedly present, as well as in the Dreamlands, coexisting with the Earth.

It is also worth noting, that Apocrean activity, as eldritch entity manifests as insomnia, as stated by the memorandum: `We at Spiral HQ are concerned about a spike in the number of knights who push themselves to the limit with lack of sleep, and Medical has noted a similar uptick in knights who want to sleep, but can't. We suspect this is at least partly due to recent Apocrean activity in the Clockworks` ([Sleep is for the Strong](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/111472)).

##### Apocrean Gear and Materials

There are more items which expand on Apocrean lore:

- `An otherworldly brand placed upon a soul claimed by the mysterious Apocrea. Removing it allows the captured soul to escape imprisonment within the terrible realm of the Apocrea` ([Apocrean Sigil](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Apocrean_Sigil#Apocrean_Sigil)). A token.
- `A jet-black shard of unnatural stone. Holding it fills your head with imagery of a distant shore where waves crash against rocks that seem to writhe in the chill of the water` ([Obsidian Shard](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Shard)). A 3-star material.

    The characteristic of this obsidian being jet-black was called out in the introduction of Underworld, specifically, [trojan horseshoes](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Trojan_Horseshoe): `A jet black horseshoe. It appears relatively harmless`.

    As for the `distant shore where waves crash against rocks`, it seems to be the case of referring to Apocrean Realm as one closely associated with water and oceans. In the context of Lovecraftian fiction, this creates an impression of a motif of shores being framed as a symbolic element of places in proximity of eldritch entities or related to those.

    But, as it is the Apocrean Realm which is near the ocean, this creates an impression for us close to one in the Cassilda's Song, where the concept of a remote location, a distant city of Carcosa in "The King in Yellow" is described as follows:

    <BookCitation source="Robert Chambers - The King in Yellow">
      Along the shore the cloud waves break,
      The twin suns sink behind the lake,
      The shadows lengthen
      In Carcosa.
    </BookCitation>

- `A strange, vile reagent thought to be harnessed by the Apocrea to build their structures. Once it gets on your skin it seems to never wash off. No, it must, you simply need to scrub harder. Harder, yes...` ([Binding Essence](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Binding_Essence)). A 4-star material.
- `A rare metal recovered from a shattered mountain deep within the realm of the Apocrea. Under a microscope it reveals to have a kind of impossible geometry. Perhaps more dedicated study, free from the distractions of the world would reveal its secrets` ([Perplexing Element](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Perplexing_Element)). A 5-star material.

    The fact that a metal was recovered from a shattered mountain makes us think of _great onyx canyons on the north of Dreamlands_. Onyx was used as primary building material for civilization of Inganok and a _particular onyx castle for Elder Gods at the top a monumental mountain Kadath_ as revealed by the events of the "[Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dream-Quest_of_Unknown_Kadath)". We believe, the part of __Apocrean Realm we have seen so far is partially inspired by the architecture of Kadath, made of onyx or, in case of Spiral Knights setting, Perplexing Element-adjacent material__.

    This material, we suggest, is not obsidian, given its name and being referred to as closest as a metal.

As weapons are acquired fom the Mysterious Alchemy Station, the creators of apocrean weapons seem to be not entities within Apocrean realm explicitly:

- `A sinister sword made from the obsidian obelisks found within the realm of the Apocrea. Simply holding it makes you somehow feel guilty of an unknown crime` ([Obsidian Edge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Edge)).
- `A deadly gun made from the obsidian obelisks found within the realm of the Apocrea. With every shot fired, a faint whisper is heard, believed to be the true name of its target` ([Obsidian Carbine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Carbine)).
- `A peculiar bomb made from the obsidian obelisks found within the realm of the Apocrea. Despite it being a bomb, some are drawn to holding it and 'solving' it as if it were some kind of puzzle` ([Obsidian Crusher](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Crusher)). The idea of it being solved reminds of the Lament Configuration puzzle box from Hellraiser franchise. There, the Lament Configuration is a portal to a different dimension.

    Given appearence of tendrins, in seemingly also serves as a portal to Apocrean Realm. And if so, rest of the gear has this property, given they are repurposed obelisks.

As all of weapons are repurposed [obsidian obelisks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Apocrean_Furniture), we have to look into those. All of obelisks have a supposedly identical description: `A jet-black stele of unnatural stone from the realm of the Apocrea. As you gaze upon it, the stone seems to writhe and pulse with an eternal energy that is simultaneously alluring and sinister in a most grotesque manner`. Obelisks are referred to be made of obsidian, which is called here as `unnatural stone`. This either positions obsidian as a unique mineral in this cosmology, or the obsidian itself is what this stone resembles most. In both cases, the symbolic link between those is present all across Apocrea.

##### Eternal energy, Obsidian and Minerals

The other aspect of obelisks is a reference to an `eternal energy` with an aspect of duality as `alluring and sinister` (`A jet-black stele of unnatural stone from the realm of the Apocrea. As you gaze upon it, the stone seems to writhe and pulse with an eternal energy that is simultaneously alluring and sinister in a most grotesque manner` - [Obsidian Obelisks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Apocrean_Furniture)). This energy can be directly observed in the aforementioned gear, as a purple glowing stream, similar to instances of glow within the Apocrean Realm-adjacent areas. As light is most cases is emanating under the broken floor brickwork, we can assume that the source of this energy - supposedly Apocrean Realm proper is metaphorically even lower.

In relation to the nature of obsidian, the [Apocrean Crown](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Apocrean_Crown) from the roster of [Obsidian Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Prize_Box) is positioned here as one of other _jewel crowns_. But, even here, it is not referred as obsidian, compared to the [rest of crowns](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Apocrean_Crown#Apocrean_Crown), but explicitly apocrean. The meaning of those crowns remains unknown so far, but, as they are constructed from suspended gemstone, we gather they are powered by the same principle as the mineral pillars across Clockworks, obsidian obelisks, potentially being close in nature to base 5 minerals, relating to underlying principle of energy, characterized, for example, by the [Static Clinger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Clinger): `A latent strand of energy that floats throughout the Clockworks, frequently catching onto hair and clothing. It's too large to properly distill into Energy, but it's very useful in alchemy`. But now, we can attribute to this _principle also a type of eternal, purple energy within the obelisks_.

##### Apocrean Disciples

Then there are cultists or the disciples. They are separated onto groups, characterized by a single property in their names.

- `Through my eyes you will see the path to ages. Pure is my gaze, free from the lies of reality'` ([Obsidian Mantle of Sight](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Mantle_of_Sight#Obsidian_Mantle_of_Sight)).

    We assume, that the hood which disciples wear, both in application and in design is meant to represent Apocrea's eyes given the same design of a face of the Harvester, as a the closest to an eldritch entity from Apocrean Realm.

    It is also here reality is established as false or deceiving, through which Apocrea's eyes or gaze allows to see through.
- `'With great practice and tender care, with an eternal heart and mind so pure: sharpen the stone, sturdy the chain, welcome the night, drink the cup of kings'` ([Obsidian Mantle of Rituals](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Mantle_of_Rituals#Obsidian_Mantle_of_Rituals)).

    As the name of the mantle contains ritual, we can assume that the process of "sharpening the stone", "sturdying the chain", "welcoming of the night", and "drinking the cup of kings" metaphorically describes that ritual. The phrase `drink the cup of kings` usually stands for a hard-to-achieve goal being fulfilled.

    The notion of `eternal heart and mind so pure` relates to pure gaze of Apocrea, and supposedly, mind. An eternal heart, we assume, is immortality, as later we will find a term of eternal engines. But in the context of ritual and act of performing it, we assume one to replicate the same characteristics as Apocrea, in order to perform the ritual.

- `'Speak with the one, true voice and they will listen. Quiet as a child's whisper, roaring like the death of this world'` ([Obsidian Mantle of Influence](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Mantle_of_Influence#Obsidian_Mantle_of_Influence)).

    It alludes to voice of Apocrea, and its duality in perception. Death of the world is a motif, so far not seen from any faction, as no one was explicitly attempting to annihilate a world.
- `'Wrap thyself in my embrace and succumb to my infinite love. Let your breath drift from you like candle smoke, dreaming deeper and deeper still'` ([Obsidian Mantle of Devotion](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Mantle_of_Devotion#Obsidian_Mantle_of_Devotion)).

As far as those items' origins go, the [announcement](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276) implies that those did come from that realm: `Plucked from the depths of the Apocrean realm, Obsidian Prize boxes are almost certainly guaranteed to not induce madness upon ownership. There is literally almost no chance you will hide one deep within your family cellar and pour over its intricate, arcane craftsmanship. And opening one will not in any way unleash a terrible, ancient entity from a world of unending, dark dreams into your own. No, instead, the Obsidian Prize Box contains an assortment of unique and very rare Apocrean treasures. These ageless, undying antiquities include: ...`. The reveal of those item essentially, apart from tropes of original Lovecraft's works, introduces Apocrea to material realm: `opening one will [not in any way] unleash a terrible, ancient entity from a world of unending, dark dreams into your own`. As here a reference goes to a single entity we can most certainly conclude it being aspect of Apocrea. The Apocrean Realm in that case is called a `world of unending, dark dreams`. __We will remember this relation to dreams and ability of Apocrea to dream once we get to the Sleeper, as its thematic and metaphysical parallels here are most distinct.__

And as far as disciples' gear goes, it represents both aspects of Apocrea, but also the type of relation of the disciples to it. All of those concepts are tied to lovecraftian horror, usually involving rituals, performed by devoted cultists, in order to summon eldritch entities, witnessing or seeing which can cause madness.

The [Apocrean Disciple Wings](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Apocrean_Disciple_Wings) imply that those are granted through the connection to Apocrea, as those have the same design as the Apocrean Crown, which is made, likely, of "obsidian," given its mineral-like texture and shape.

Then, there are arctic acolytes: `A plated robe said to be worn by wandering arctic acolytes. 'we saw them heading straight towards the mountains, off into the interior of the vast frozen continent, but why?'` ([Arctic Acolyte Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arctic_Acolyte_Mantle)). Given identical design, differing in material, but common lovecraftian horror theme, we link those too, to Apocrea or Underworld with the frost of Blinding Abyss, as [discussed in relation to Nefarious Imp](). Due to close similarity of both, and our theorized role of the Imp, we have to consider him being an important figure both for themes and entities of Apocrean Realm and Underworld, connection the two.

There are also some architectural motifs, but those are likely an asset reuse: Graveyard of [Blades of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blades_of_the_Fallen) outside of Haven contains an obelisk, are shaped as miniature versions of the ziggurat found in the [Obsidian Nexus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Obsidian_Nexus), if a case of asset reuse to be omitted. It is important also to note in the context of tortodrones, Call of The Colossi contains the same rectangular obelisk located to to the left of the entrance elevator and before the arena, suggesting that it is th result of the same cultural and architectural phenomenon of ritual circles being spread to Cradle and its civilizations from the Underworld.

All of those motifs combined, and represented in disciples, seem to suggest an opposition to the nature of reality of material realm as one concealing a truth.

##### Underworld and Apocrean Realm

Finally it is important to specify connection of Underworld and Apocrean Realm in their common relation to souls, partially covered in the [Minerals and Souls section](#minerals-and-souls-part-1).

Everfrost tower brought from Underworld functions as a prison for the souls. Then there are auras, which Black Kats consume. Apocrea sets up traps across Clockworks, which lead up to the Apocrean Harvester. In relation to Apocrea, one entity is seemingly native to Underworld - [Scarabs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scarab), - as they can be coupled with even devilites across [Grasping Plateau](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Grasping_Plateau).

Amongst those elements one thing in particular will be very important: `The Apocrea bend reality, twisting the environment they invade into a trap` ([Obsidian Nexus - Lost Soul](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Obsidian_Nexus)), - an ability to warp reality, an eldritch ability. This ties with the prior concept of the Plateau of Leng and Grasping 3*9+-Plateau as connected, as both exist in an undefined state, between the dimensions or realms. In case of latter, as plateau is a trap, and harvester is there to traverse it, than Apocrean realm proper we suggest would not be far.

__Due to those properties of Apocrean Realm, we believe that it presents in a long term a far greater danger to material realm, rather than strictly Underworld.__

The motivation behind Apocrea's actions suggest an essential aspect of souls to their existence as well to currently established cosmology. This would mean that souls are formed or at least arrive to material realm, and are naturally nonexistent in the Underworld, despite having many purposes there, as discussed in regards to [Underworld's technology](#fiendish-glyphs).

##### The Metaphysical Stack

It is here that we may begin to build a vertical stack of realms, where souls, for lack of better word, _flow from top to the bottom of the world, accompanied by symbolism and mythology_.

We propose that at the very bottom of this stack it is either the Apocrean Realm, as it seemingly exists outside of a general structure - `in the deep dark below, beyond the space where time wakens and yawns, beyond the shadows cast by the great leviathan of eternity` ([Professor Allister Danford](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)), and 2 other candidates, Blinding Abyss and the Void.

It is such due to a connotations of the Abyss across cultures - being the deepest point of the world, as presented in the [analysis of the Abyss](#perma-frostifurs-and-blinding-abyss). The Void, on the other hand, requires for us to analyze 3 more time periods, where in laws of this cosmology are observed. But even at this stage, we have a foundation for this cosmology, referred in this section, as the metaphysical stack.

So there is a material realm, it is connected with Underworld, although requiring a ritual or a device, such as a ritual circle or grim gates. Both of those methods of traversal require energy, that same energy is present in Underworld but in lesser amount and in the form of souls, which arrive there after death in the material realm, wherein their possess auras.

Undercorp is located in the Underworld. Below the Underworld, it is Apocrean Realm, an even more ancient location. Finally, there is Blinding Abyss, whose elements have a significant power over material realm as seen during the events of [Heart of Ice](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_ice). All of those realms are seemingly connected and have access to the material realm, but very little of them communicate with it. In the end one final realm remains, which was mentioned at the very beginning of the theory - the Nameless Realm (`A forbidden mantle said to grant the wearer protection within the nameless realm where all elements are said to converge into one and divide into all` - [Chaos cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_cloak)). We will revisit it later, as in order to analyze it, we have to cover rest of past history, specifically [Kingdom of Almire](#chapter-vi-kingdom-of-almire) and [Owlites, and Kat Tribe](#chapter-viii-kat-tribe).

On that note, one thing in particular we will remember until further notice, is a specific wording in Danford's journal entry: `All of them mere crops against their relentless scythe! Though they may steal sanctuary in the cracks and corners of their terrible realm, it is ever fleeting. The blinding gaze of the Apocrea is boundless` ([Professor Allister Danford](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)).

##### Apocrean Engines

`In the deep dark below, beyond the space where time wakens and yawns, beyond the shadows cast by the great leviathan of eternity, the Apocrea stir. Within cities where geometry and madness share meaning, constructed from thought, from unnatural impulse, the Apocrea dream dark machines into being. Only souls keep these engines roaring, heard screaming across distant stars. Only souls can fill their void, sublime in its vast emptiness. Oh such beautiful souls! Bright and vibrant like fruit warming on the branch from a summer‚Äôs sun, longing for the pull of the earth below, the chance to seed and grow and birth anew. What terrible naivety! What utter farce! All of them mere crops against their relentless scythe! Though they may steal sanctuary in the cracks and corners of their terrible realm, it is ever fleeting. The blinding gaze of the Apocrea is boundless. The daylight, the starlight; all hope is merely waiting for their dark shroud to return this cosmic play to its primordial black` ([Professor Allister Danford](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)).

Apocrea dreams and creates into reality unknown machines, powered by souls. At the same time, souls are sought after by Apocrea for potentially other uses. Here, they are presented as metaphorical fruits, and given the presence of the sun and a tree, we suggest it being more literal - that as if souls were flowing from a higher realm, and then in the established contexts drawn to to taken by Apocrea. It is also here we have mention of `all hope is merely waiting for their dark shroud to return this cosmic play to its primordial black` - it will be important [later](#the-void-part-2).

Considering Apocrean Realm is an eldritch location, it must be analyzed on the notion of dreams in relation to Outer Gods of Lovecraft's universe. This notion of dreams, of course, will be later important in the context of the Core, Whitespace, Sleeper and the Swarm, but here it is not the main topic.

As Dreamlands were already mentioned as a potential inspiration behind the design of the obsidian architecture, we will touch upon the role of dreams in their universe:

- Carter had to travel to the Dreamlands in search of the dreamt sunset city. It is suggested by Nyarlathotep, that the city was stollen by the Old Gods due to its beauty, but this information cannot be trusted.
- [The Dreams in the Witch-House](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dreams_in_the_Witch-House) tell about a different side of the nature of dreams - as a method of transportation into other realities, traversal through those realities, other locations and time periods.
- The same ability to travel higher realities and time periods is also examined by the Silver Key in the story of [Through the Gates of the Silver Key](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Through_the_Gates_of_the_Silver_Key), its prequel and sequels.

Although this is not much context on dreams, it may allow us to better understand this notion. But, in order to make conclusion about it, we have to analyze, of course, the Sleeper within Cradle's Core, while keeping Lovecraftian inspirations for potential background information and themes in mind.

### _Chapter `VII`_ Kingdom of Almire

We begin from a time when kingdom of Almire was invaded by neighboring kingdoms.

The first time a war is mentioned in the Owlite tome within the [Forgotten Library](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/An_Occurrence_at_Owlite_Keep#Gate_Map) of Owlite Keep: `... This world has seen few greater tragedies than the fall of the great Kingdom of Almire. Once a vibrant, beautiful realm of lush forests and sweeping plains ... neighboring kingdoms declared war ... seeking the power needed to turn the tide, Lord Vanaduke of Almire fled into the mountains...` ([An Occurrence at Owlite Keep - The Forgotten Library - Owlite tome](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_tome_text_Dialogue/The_Forgotten_Library)).

In the same mission we have descriptions of what was left of Kingdom of Almire in modern times: `An unlikely source of intel has surfaced from the residents of Moorcroft Manor. A few of the spookats that call it home contacted one of our visiting Recon Knights and provided details of the negative energy mass that has appeared above the Core. Calling it 'a place of burning hatred' and 'a prison for dark souls' they say that you can read all about it in 'one of those weird Owlite books' in an Owlite keep they pinpointed` ([An Occurrence at Owlite Keep](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/An_Occurrence_at_Owlite_Keep)), and retelling of Recon Rangers: `Recon Knights have said that all they see near it is fire, endless fire` ([Ending in Fire - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ending_in_Fire)).

In-game content creates a vague description of the timeline, mostly outlining general themes and events, but we can find a more precise and detailed description of those events, one which connects the concept of fire deity, Lord Vanaduke, and `neighboring kingdoms` even closer.

The existence of 3 kingdoms, their ongoing conflict, and the aftermath are given by a short story of [Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/index.php?title=Firestorm_Citadel&oldid=1263). So far we need to focus on the identity of the 2 kingdoms: `The citadel comes from a land divided by constant war between the nations of three kingdoms. ... It was ruled by a young and determined king known as Lord Vanaduke. Praised for his military ability, it was because of this that Almire was a powerful nation despite it being the smallest of the three. Given time it could expand to a mighty empire. It was because of this the other two kings feared him and formed a truce to invade Almire. Vanaduke's army was stretched too thin and Almire quickly began to fall under the weight of the two combined armies` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/index.php?title=Firestorm_Citadel&oldid=1263)). But, before it, we need to discuss the entry itself, as we won't come back to it later.

#### Diegesis of "Almire's Fall"

Almire's Fall lore entry [had originated on the official wiki](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/index.php?title=Firestorm_Citadel&oldid=1263), rather than forums or items' descriptions, as discovered by Spiralka-chan on the Arcade Discord server. The [edit shows](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/index.php?title=Firestorm_Citadel&oldid=1263), that the author of this story snippet is one of the core members of developers' team. We consider it as a solid proof of this entry being canon to an overarching story, but with a few caveats regarding its in-universe placement. Despite being seemingly a minor detail, we will explore it properly, as its implications of being present on the wiki open a new perspective onto capabilities and technological advancement of Spiral Order in the field.

As the entry is present on the wiki, it marks wiki itself as present in the inner structure of Spiral Order.

Most of the text on Almire so far was written by Owlites, so Almire's Fall should also be attributed to them, - it seems as a plausible explanation, given Owlites' other researches.

But, on the other hand, as wiki has the same design as game's HUD, it is meant to be associated with the base game. Its design can be attributed to Spiral Order. As from player's perspective, an Isoran member of Spiral Order, access to the wiki can be considered canon, that it is accessed both from player's end, and by knight, based on the prior concept of knight's HUD following those ideas.

If we would attempt to fit this snippet into prior Owlite tome based on remaining text, they would not align, suggesting them being different texts. But both texts discuss the same topic, so existence of multiple texts within Owlite civilization in regards to the kingdom is possible. Due to those factors, and the application of Forgotten Library and Eternal Study, as being researched by Spiral Order, makes source of this text being potentially taken from Owlites.

We lean to Almire's Fall being not originally written by Spiral Order. Despite this, researchers of Haven Lab did discover more information regarding Almire, given present artifacts of past civilizations including Almire, as well as a dialogue with one of biotechs studying [Almirian Seal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_Seal_(Furniture)): `there were massive citadels housing Almire's armed forces and great estates for its noble houses ... We assume the kingdom is still a smoldering ruin somewhere`. But it is due to their research, we suggest that is how the final text of Almire's Fall was gathered, - an accumulation of both Spiral Order and Owlite research.

While we can't distinct what parts were written by Spiral Order and by Owlites, one thing seems to us most certain. The _description of the events, through which Lord Vanaduke had gone through during his time in the mountains_, had to be written by someone from that period of time, unless that part of the story is told outside of the capabilities of any civilization, while still remaining canon.

While we have a history of Spiral Order communicating with undead in a non-violent manner, the spirit, or Lost Souls of Almire, the aforementioned events could not be told by anyone apart from Lord Vanaduke himself, _rendering this part as external to the canon of the wiki_.

#### Three Kingdoms

Now, with Almire's Fall taken into consideration, we can start to parse through them. There are 2 kingdoms specified to exist.

It is likely that in order to invade Kingdom of Almire, they had to be located _near enough or even bordering Kingdom of Almire_ due to their reasoning of Almire having a potential of gaining more power, and, as an empire, subsequent land.

We have a potential clue in a form of the fact Lord Vanaduke did come from the mountains with an army: `Leading an army of terrible fiends, Vanaduke returned to his kingdom, destroying the occupied forces of the two opposing kingdoms in a single day. In time the two kingdoms fell, Vanaduke's legion burning everything in their path` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall)), suggesting they were likely traversing over land.

We propose those 2 kingdoms are northern Raiders, first introduced [in the context of Isorans general](#spiral-raiders), and the kingdom of Ironmight, one never explicitly mentioned, but one we will explore in detail by gathering evidence for its existence.

This proposal at its base stems from the idea of all 3 kingdoms being descendants of ancient, but already spacefaring [Isorans](#spacefarers-of-old) - we have discussed plausibility of this concept in the [analysis of Ghost in the Machine](#ghosts-in-the-machine). The general idea behind this logic is based on the context and designs of [Iron Hulk](#ghosts-in-the-machine) _as being an Isoran or Morai vessel_. And, as it is hundred years old, while greater Isoran spacefaring civilization is far older, _why there were not to be a second case of an even more ancient space vessel crash landing on this planet, preceding Cradle_, which would give start to the events of this chapter?

If Cradle or a planet preceding it was already found prior, time span of several hundred of years does not seem to us a restriction. Then, since [Isorans were eons old](#spacefarers-of-old), while being an interstellar species, seems to us probable in the context of a stumbling on Cradle through different means and in different time, referring to a planet preceding Cradle as a mechanical planet.

#### Ironmight Kingdom

The name Ironmight, if we refer to it properly, as a potential Kingdom of Ironmight, makes us think of other similar instances or naming conventions of empires and kingdoms:

- Kingdom of the Netherlands, meaning a lower land, lower elevation, a property of geographical location.
- United Kingdom, one that consists of multiple entities united by a monarch.
- Holy Roman Empire combines an adjective, - Holy, - with a city of Rome.

As for Ironmight, judging by its name, it has similar morphology. It is derived from a descriptive term of might and is combined with iron, iron and might, - _the might of iron_. We suggest that it is a kingdom, one similar to Almire, with part of its identity being rooted in its military power, or as we will see, economic might. We will attempt to exclude a possibility of it being an empire - as an Ironmight Empire, - as we will attempt to fit it with the lore entry of Almire' Fall.

The basis for the Ironmight, as the name itself, we extract from the [Ironmight set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironmight_Plate_Mail). Through those items we can start to notice relations between the kingdoms before their conflict.

The concept of a kingdom of Ironmight was proposed separately from our research by [user Magnicth on Spiral Knight subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/spiral_knights/comments/zakpe/the_ironmight_theory/).

##### Ironmight Shield, Crowns, and Coins

The glowing emblem on the [Ironmight Plate Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironmight_Plate_Shield) - `A superior shield forged from sun silver. The meaning of the crest on its face has been lost to time`, - _is the same emblem of a crown, engraved on the coins found across Clockworks_, persisting on Cradle to this day.

The dimensions of the currency and shield's emblem are identical. There are _matching star symbols in cardinal direction on the outer ring_ of the emblem and of the [coins](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crowns#Finding_Crowns) of all nominal values.

This particular coincidence does seem intentional, due to application of that symbol on the shield specifically. The other similar shield with a mysterious glowing emblem, the [Volcanic Plate Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Shield), also seems intentional design choice, but will be covered separately.

Could presence of stars mean symbolic location of the crown - the monarch of a kingdom, - in the center of the Universe or night sky, as one surrounded or protected by stars? Or, is the kingdom ruling over stars in all cardinal directions as if being located at their symbolic center, in teh center of known Universe? We refer to this motif here as often a monarch would've been considered a divine ruler, through the application of the concept of the _Divine Right of Kings_. While this can be assumed for Ironmight kingdom, we also have similar theme of divinity in Almire, due to [their connection to Spirit Mother](#almire-and-spirit-mother).

One thing is particular may point in that thematic direction is the description of the [Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore): `An extremely rare metal of great power said to be from the heavens above. It is often completely wasted on crowns and jewelry for slime royalty` ([Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore)). From the celestial ore one other element of kingship or monarchy is made - [Ice Queen Crown](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ice_Queen_Crown), as it uses Celestial Ore in its alchemy.

It is common across history for crowns be made of rare, precious metals, but also that same notion can be attributed coins, - in case of Spiral Knight, crowns, which are also metallic as seen from their designs.

In this interpretation, kingdom's currency had persisted on Cradle far past the kingdom itself, while being adopted by slime royalty and other civilizations later into the timeline.

There is also presence of [sun silver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_silver#Usage), which was present in Isoran equipment - such as [Azure Guardian armor and weapons](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Armor) and [Valkyrian armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Mail), as well as the [Divine Avenger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Avenger), which was discussed in relation to the [Heavenly Guardian Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Guardian_Armor) in [similarity of Isorans to valkyries](#similarity-to-heavenly-kingdom).

This does not mean that Jelly civilization is involved into the Almirian conflict, but rather serves as a modern example of common practices being applied. We should note how sun silver is already present across the Universe and other civilizations, now with the addition of celestial ore, and as both contain heavenly themes.

There might be a greater link to a heavenly kingdom referred by Valkyries, as not a strictly physical place, given [origins of castles](#castles), but bordering a potentially divine and less physical realm - an idea in concept resembling the myth regarding Asgard of norse mythology, introduced in the [analysis of fiendish statues across castles](#fiendish-statues).

##### Strategic Use of Ironwood

The [Ironmight Plate Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironmight_Plate_Mail) mentioned rare metals in its descriptions: `Superior plate mail forged from an alloy of several rare metals. its restrictive, but incredibly strong` ([Ironmight Plate Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironmight_Plate_Mail)). From the currently present materials, metals specifically, in an established cosmology we have a few:

- `An extraordinary metal imbued with the radiant light of the sky` ([Sun Silver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Silver)). It has a relation to heavens and the sun.
- `A rare metal recovered from a shattered mountain deep within the realm of the Apocrea` ([Perplexing Element](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Perplexing_Element)). This metal does not seem to be related to the current case of Almire nor other kingdoms.
- `An extraordinary metal imbued with the creeping darkness of the Underworld` ([Shadow Steel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadow_Steel)). Although it was covered in relation to Underworld, this metal does not seem to be related to the current case, but may be potentially applied to [Volcanic Plate Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Shield), possessing elemental defense.
- `An extraordinary metal imbued with the savage spirit of the wild` ([Primal Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Ore)). It is related to a few piercing-related gear, amongst which Kat Tribe equipment is notable. It is also said to be extraordinary metal.
- `An extraordinary metal imbued with the blazing energy of magma` - [Volcanic Iron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Iron) is absent in the volcanic plate set, but is present in the similar in design [Volcanic Demo set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Demo_Suit).

Both [volcanic](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Mail) and [ironmight](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironmight_Plate_Mail) variants of plate armor use rare samples of wood:

  - `A sturdy chunk of fine, unfinished wood. It's typically used in the production of cabinets` ([Redwood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Redwood)).
  - `A peculiar piece of wood that just won't stay put` ([Driftwood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Driftwood)).
  - `A pristine log of one of the hardest substances known to the Spiral Knights` ([Ironwood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironwood)).
  - We will also propose an existence of a 5-star wood material, wyrmwood, discussed later in a [different section](#twisting-trees-and-wyverns), as it is not relevant here.

All of those wood samples are directly used in the alchemy of Ironmight and Volcanic armor sets and shields, suggesting presence of advanced enough technology to melt and use it.

While those names are present in real world, here, we believe, they are _recontextualised to have a more fantasy-adjacent interpretation_ of fictional wood, most evident by the description of ironwood: `A pristine log of one of the hardest substances known to the Spiral Knights` ([Ironwood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironwood)), - _of a literal metal of iron_.

Ironwood through its name, description, and recipes, serves a strategic role as the base material for the armor manufactured by Ironmight kingdom. We will return to other types of wood later in the [context of gremlin operations](#twisting-trees-and-wyverns).

As for the forging of ironwood, [Volcanic Plate Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Shield) states: `It is so resistant to high temperatures that its a mystery how exactly it was forged in the first place`, which might suggest that some skills were acquired to work with near-magical or elemental materials. Notably, it is the [flame souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul) which are used in the alchemy of volcanic set (`A powerful essence that left behind when a creature perishes during a blind, fiery rage` - [Flame Soul](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul)).

Although this description does relate to a concept of rage, we believe that this is less of a connection to tortomega, but a larger universal concept of normal damage and rage being symbolically connected. Could it be, that normal-only defenses of the [Volcanic Plate Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Shield) compared to the elementally-resistant volcanic armor set represent this connection?

If we assume that not only ironmight set belongs to Ironmight kingdom, but also volcanic set, given their similarity in design, would Ironmight kingdom develop a skill of tempering with elemental forces to the point of discovering elemental damage and defenses?

On the other hand, the suggested design is universal across plated armors - such as [Ancient Plate Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Armor), which we have proposed to belong to tortomega, and adapted to Isoran anatomy. And, _given fiery themes of fallen Almire, would volcanic plate armor rather fit to them, rather than Kingdom of Ironmight_? We will keep those concepts in mind.

##### Volcanic Elements

The [Volcanic Plate set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Mail) has elemental defenses, but [Ironmight set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironmight_Plate_Mail) has piercing defenses, which is reminiscent of Spiral Order cobalt armor alchemy tree.

This scenario was already covered in relation to Spiral Order main line of armors, apart from [padded armor alchemy tree](#padded-armor), and here we may observe a similar scenario - likely, a lack of knowledge of other damage types due to, possibly, lack of encounters with such entities.

With Almire being located near the mountains with a deity's shrine inside: `Then one day he discovered a small cave that radiated with unnatural warmth, smelling of ash and sulfur. Within it he discovered a great chamber whose floor was waist deep in ashes. They were warm, and Vanaduke soon felt the sting of hot coals through his tattered boots. At the center of the chamber was a blackened shrine, whose deity's features were worn and indistinguishable. ... citizens of Almire watched as fire began to erupt from the mountains` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall)), - it is likely that even geographical position of Almire, its proximity to the mountains, was desirable by Ironmight kingdom in order to either start, or to seize, in case of Almire, the production of elemental-infused gear.

As the theme of fire is present in both cases, we can suggest a goal being creation of armor imbued with the [flame souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul) and forged of [volcanic iron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Iron), in a volcano, given shield's description: `It is so resistant to high temperatures that it's a mystery how exactly it was forged in the first place` ([Volcanic Plate Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Shield)).

It is here also it is important to note a relation between [flame souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul), alchemy of [volcanic set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Mail), and [volcanic iron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Iron) - `An extraordinary metal imbued with the blazing energy of magma`.

We propose that the relation is based on the concept of _flame souls being present within volcanic iron_, giving it its elemental characteristics, notably, in the [Volcanic Plate Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Helm), __which uses flame soul in alchemy, but volcanic iron in its description__: `A superior plate helmet forged from volcanic iron. It's difficult to breathe in, but it can resist high temperatures and any number of savage attacks` ([Volcanic Plate Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Helm)).

With this in mind, we believe, this logic can be applied onto the [Volcanic Plate Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Shield): `A superior shield imbued with the elemental essence of flame. It is so resistant to high temperatures that it's a mystery how exactly it was forged in the first place`, as well as the rest of volcanic gear - that of __volcanic iron containing or being imbued with flame souls__.

Based on this, one parallel can be drawn here with the concept introduced in the [minerals and souls section](#minerals-and-souls-part-1) between mineral pillars potentially capable of containing energy, with a prime example being everfrost. [Fire Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Fire_Soul) themselves, we suggest, are aggravated [Flame Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul), as flame souls are inherently linked to the elemental nature of enemies, and potentially, Lord Vanaduke's curse and fire deity within the mountain, as their influence seemingly had bound Almirian Souls to material realm and [corporeal bodies](#corporeal-body).

The glowing symbol on shield's front face can potentially be related to the glow of [Gran Faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gran_Faust) and intricate patterns found on inner side of [Gorgofist](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgofist) as well as other tortodrone-related gear. But as far as we are aware of setting's metaphysics, no reason apart from the design can be drawn for now.

As for the Lord Vanaduke's search in the mountains, we relate back to 2 concepts:

- `A helm worm by heavenly guardians who watch over a kingdom hidden atop a magma-covered mountain` ([Avenger's Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raging_Avenger_Helm#Storm_Avenger_Helm)).
- `A helm worn by members of the Scarlet Scouts. Designed to frighten their enemies, this helm is in the visage of a fiend who lives in the mountains of a distant land. Said to guard the gate to heaven itself, it only allows those who are worthy to pass` ([Oni Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Oni_Helm)).

Those mythological notions are not currently applicable to the context of kingdom of Almire, but we will keep them in mind for the analysis of Lord Vanaduke's encounter with the fire deity.

#### Almire and Spirit Mother

Almirian regalia is based on a medieval crown, most clearly seen on the [Almirian Restored Tapestry](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Restored_Tapestry#Restored_Tapestry): _a crown, through which grows a dark branching tree with red leaves and white wings at its roots_.

It can be confirmed that those are tree branches rather that black ironwork, based on the design of [Crest of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crest_of_Almire), wherein the black lines seem to behave as tree branches in relation to owns' shape and presence of red leaves.

Despite being gear of Spiral Order, we lean for it here as an affirmation of the presented nature-themes Almirian design. The nature-themed designs are seen across [all restored furniture](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almire_Furniture_Box), reminiscent of water fountains of the Spirit Mother and [Nature Sprites](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nature_Sprite), suggesting a deeper and longer relation.

Those [Nature Sprites](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nature_Sprite) have colored fur coat and furry striped ears not very similar to [tier 3 dust bunnies](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dust_bunny), in contrast to devoid of fur devilites. The fact that they are capable of being cursed, which restricts there power, they seem to be also influenced by the Underworld.

The union of Almire and Spirit Mother might be the reason why they would try to right Lord Vanaduke's wrongs (`I've heard that some kind of force of nature had once tried to right his wrongs but Lord Vanaduke imprisoned it somewhere within his fortress. Finding and freeing it may prove useful` - [Nameless Lost Soul of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire_(nameless))).

At that, Almire itself translates from a name in Urdu as "aristocratic", which might serve as a hint at more existing connection through the name's origin to south-east cultures and countries. Specifically, the translation also is suggested to be an "aristocratic lady". Could it be linked to the Spirit Mother? Maybe as a literal kingdom of Spirit Mother, since spirit mother is directly mentioned in relation to the burning kingdom, as it would be her domain?

Moreover, this connection of the kingdom with Spirit Mother can be affirmed through the announcement of [Almire Furniture Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almire_Furniture_Box): `Does your guild better commune with the Spirit Mother in her faraway realm?` ([Decorate your Guild Hall with the splendors of Almire!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/102786)).

Then there is power of water from Spirit Mother's Realm: `a force of nature summoned to this realm to extinguish the unnatural fire that is consuming it. ... Now none may proceed beyond the court as columns of shadow fire block all exits. Shadow fire can only be extinguished with the water that flows from these spirit wells. The water is the purest found in all of nature, flowing directly from the springs within the realm of the Spirit Mother herself` ([Firestorm Citadel - Nature Sprite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nature_Sprite)). This water is placed in opposition to the shadow fires, whose nature we will discuss [later](#nature-of-darkfire).

This spirit realm was not encountered or mentioned in any other place across Clockworks. But, there is one single instance of a place referred to as a realm, and also referred only single time - [the Nameless Realm](#nameless-realm), introduced in the Chaos Cloak: `A forbidden mantle said to grant the wearer protection within the nameless realm where all elements are said to converge into one and divide into all` ([Chaos Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_cloak)). Although a hypothesis at that point, __the fact that Nature Sprite does not name Spirit Mother's realm by a distinguished name__ may be a potential reason to be the latter being named as such, - nameless. One thing that is shared across both, as we will [later discuss](#chapter-viii-kat-tribe), is _the innate aspect of divinity of both_.

It is important to note now, that Chaos Cloak is an Owlite armor, and considering further analysis of Owlite and their advancements in elemental magic, they regard the mantle as forbidden likely due to its connection to the Nameless Realm.

_This does seem contradictory, if both were meant to represent divinity_, - and its true, but we are missing on the alchemical aspect of [Nameless Realm](#nameless-realm), forming its characteristic duality, which will be also discussed.

Apart from it, we have not yet discussed in detail aforementioned divinity of Nameless Realm. Both this and the possibility of a connection to Spirit Mother will be addressed in the analysis of [Kat Tribe](#chapter-viii-kat-tribe).

One last connection of Spirit Mother to Almire will be brought up during the [analysis of the blackened shrine](#blackened-shrine-and-magma-deity), as themes of water and volcanic eruptions permeate across many different cultures.

#### Raiders and Pagan Vikings

The last of 3 kingdoms remains unknown. Here we propose that the third kingdom was based on a time period of viking invasions from 8 to 11 century.

We suggest this mainly due to the existence of [Raider Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raiders_Prize_Box). We will attempted to analyze it in relation to Isorans with a presumption, that those items are historically accurate, that they exist in confinements of the setting according the [prior analysis of raiders](#spiral-raiders).

Then there is case of total lack of any, even vague history of Isorans. Apart from them being an ancient spacefaring civilization, a period involving guns in an western theming, and of an existential war with Morai, there is no history on Isoran civilization. Due to this any equipment referencing any other less technologically advanced era should be capable of explanation. We believe, historical accuracy should be upheld here, mixed with semi-fantastic, medieval-inspired designs. At that, we should focus on one of main guiding elements of Isoran technology - [of lack of advanced damage types](#lack-of-damage-types), which are present for this ancient equipment.

Due to this, a sudden release of items, relating to Isoran past, when their entire history is virtually unknown, seems odd to us, compared to the rest of items being relatively new, as modern enough for plausibility of being wielded by a spacefaring civilization.

We propose, that raiding equipment, apart fom being Isoran, should fit into an established time period, which so far was not discussed. This period is the time, we suspect, was before Almire was invaded, with raiders representing the second invading kingdom.

One notion we have to also mention here, apart from a _concept of raiders not having a kingdom in the first place as going against historically accurate vikings_, is that they in later periods of time were serving as mercenaries, with their work being done even in Mediterranean Sea, albeit after their transition from paganism to Christianity. It is important as in the Raider Prize Box there are items referencing elements of their older culture.

Here we might think of raider's equipment being designed with Spiral Order or an order of old insignia, but, we only saw the case of utilitarian, functional aspects of equipment being adapted by Spiral Order and not its cultural background, and no placement for Spiral Order symbolism, which is present both on the prize box and equipment itself.

Before we proceed further, we have to argue that there is heavenly kingdom of Valkyries, seemingly located above 3 mountains, one of which was `magma-covered` (`A helm worm by heavenly guardians who watch over a kingdom hidden atop a magma-covered mountain` - [Raging Avenger Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raging_Avenger_Helm)).

While they seem as a preferable candidate for the second kingdom, as they are named as such and seem old enough for this time period, _they are in the sky_, - and the Kingdom of Almire is on earth, with Lord Vanaduke's army on earth.

This distinction is too significant to consider heavenly kingdom as an actor in that war, and that is without considering them being framed as a heavenly, divine kingdom, standing in opposition to Underworld. Considering this, [we do have a later connection of them and Almire](#almirian-empire).

On the other hand, heavenly kingdom being the second kingdom would characterize them as more nuanced, but we have so far very small amount of evidence to suggest it, as well as this approach would be too thematically misfitting in the context of the rest of their framing in the setting.

At that, undead zombies are found across castles of heavenly kingdom, in a similar manner to howlitzers, which we [have linked to war with dragons](#howlitzers-dragons-and-drakes). But, as we will discuss further, we believe this element of undeath will be proven relevant in a _period of time, happening after Lord Vanaduke's return and him defeating armies of the 2 invading kingdoms_.

##### Concept of Firestorm

Raiders are seemingly inspired by popularized cultural perception of Vikings, which might suggest a vague time period at which we can operate as well as place the events of Almire's Fall.

By presence of [Firestorm Skeggox](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Skeggox) - `An ornate, fiery axe favored by raiders for its versatility`, - with an energy symbol we can confirm this inspiration and relation to Vikings.

Based on [Squall Caller](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Squall_Caller) - `An ornate hammer infused with the power of a great storm, it's as cutting-edge as a blunt weapon can be`, - we can gather, that this period of raiding history relates to a time, to draw parallels, norse pagans,  - that is prior to their christianization and establishment of own territory to defend on the European mainland.

This is seems to us important, as the weapon such as Squall Caller, does resemble Mj√∂lnir, a hammer, serving both as a weapon and a tool for thunder god Thor of Norse mythology. And potentially connection to storms of this cosmology, as elemental damage is attributed to them.

At the same time, labeling them as a kingdom, sets them, considering possible mainland location of Almire near mountains, as an already established, organized kingdom, which, in case of vikings happened only some time later. Although real history does not have a distinct event, dividing pre- and post- christianization vikings, as the pagan traditions did carry on, the design decisions for the equipment allow us only to hypothesize so far.

<!-- Apart from that, one other element was not earlier addressed - the key feature of mounted warden's head - [Raider Helm Crest](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raider_Helm_Crest). With the general depiction of a warden, one detail is out of place - the ears, or possibly, horns. Although we can't say for sure if it is the latter and not a change in ears' shape due to model itself, this can potentially mean something. Moreover, this element is depicted on the [prize box itself](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raiders_Prize_Box), as it is seen above warden's eye. Two possible suggestions we can come up with: leaning forwards ears are meant to symbolize alertness, considering raiders' lifestyle, and the other - a depiction of norse myth of Sleipnir, an eight-legged Odin's horse. Sleipnir he was capable of traveling across all nine realms of Norse cosmology, including realm of the dead. -->

The [Firestorm Raider Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Raider_Helm#Firestorm_Raider_Helm) is described as `a pristine raider helmet, save for a few dings and a thick coat of ash`, suggesting that it became such after fall of Almire, as it burned, as well as continuous raids on it despite destruction of 2 kingdoms by Lord Vanaduke.

Raiders did came from cold regions as seen by overall design. And _based on the significance of the context behind firestorm,_ __its usage here is meant to be associated with Firestorm Citadel__. Moreover, given [Frenzied Firestorm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzied_Firestorm#Frenzied_Firestorm) Drakon ability upgrade, this concept of a firestorm may be more fundamental, than the adjective Firestorm Citadel is given: `All that remains is a great citadel that seems to be engulfed in never-ending flames that Spiral HQ has been calling the 'Firestorm Citadel'. From what we can tell, the whole place is swarming with undead and built like a fortress` ([Eye of the Needle - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Eye_of_the_Needle)), as it is related to dragons to characterize one of their aspects, of resembling a storm of fire.

The fact that modern Spiral Order had given the Citadel such name, paralleling raiders' naming convention, if the raiders did come from past, seems us another link, connection the two civilizations as related by nature of being Isorans.

Lost Souls also refer to the Citadel as such: `You stand before the gates of the Firestorm Citadel, the former heart of the great Kingdom of Almire, now a dominion twisted by fire and malice` ([King of Ashes - Blackstone Bridge - Lost Soul](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_(Blackstone_Bridge))). We consider those Lost Souls being also people of Almire due to their presence within the Citadel and hinted benevolent motives, shared between all Almirian Souls.

We propose, that Raider, as their real world counterparts, __came from norse seas or regions, which allowed them to survive Lord Vanaduke's campaign from the mountains__ and _then come back to now ashen land of kingdom of Almire_ once they were defeated on the mainland.

Considering many potential parallels and inspirations behind this setting we suggest that an approximate relation between kingdoms follows a pattern:

- Kingdom of Almire, being of celtic background and a nature or water goddess of Spirit Mother.
- Spiral Raiders being pagans, as pre-Christianized vikings, yet they could have a land and own kingdom to defend as part of the setting.
- Ironmight Kingdom, being a powerful state, which in addition to raiders has managed to suppress Almire, with many inspirations leading to events somewhere around Norman conquest of England, and potentially Ireland.

##### Caladbolg and Irish Mythology

As for the relation to Ireland, there is [Lucky Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lucky_Prize_Box). Apart from being, of course, a prize box with cosmetics, it is the design of those cosmetics which we are interested in, apart from a notion of those themed items being present in gaming culture in general.

But, as we will discuss, ancient Irish celtic traditions and culture have a potential of being related back to the kingdom of Almire. We have to keep in mind that the basis for those inspirations behind said kingdoms is not strictly required to resemble any real-world events, but their themes.

Major element of Almire's culture is based on its relation to water and Spirit Mother. As we commit to a chronology where raiders are in the similar time span as Almire and Ironmight kingdoms, we suggest a potential relation to Irish kingdoms.

As it was pointed out earlier, raiders seem to belong to pagans, mainly due to their equipment with motifs from Norse mythology. It may be plausible for this instance of paganism being the alignment to ancient concepts of spiral and energy.

As on the contrary, kingdom of Almire is aligned with the Spirit Mother. This concept of a connection can be vaguely seen in the _Tuatha D√© Danann civilization of Irish mythology_. Tuatha D√© Danann were a race of divine beings and among them was the goddess Danu, who was _associated with nature, fertility, earth and water_. Danu also represents the fertile ground from which life springs and is _associated with rivers and flowing water_. This connection is seen in natural motif and designs of Almirian furniture, as well as in the water fountains of Almire whose water was taken from the Spirit Mother's Realm, capable of affecting the curse set by cursed Lord Vanaduke.

A possible connection to Irish mythology may be established also through items of Lucky Prize Box, specifically [Pot O' Crowns](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pot_O%27_Crowns) and [Caladbolg](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Caladbolg), both dealing elemental fire damage. The latter item, the sword, seem to us important, as by the legends of medieval Irish mythology - Ulster Cycle - Caladbolg belongs to a king of Ulster. Another name for this kingdom is Ulaid, one of five and later four kingdoms of Ireland on par with Munster, reminiscent of 3 warring kingdoms.

##### Giant Sword

Another element of similar design is located in the Wolver Den, a [scenario room with a giant sword stuck in stone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-Wolver_Den_2.png).

The sword is said to have a star map engraved on it, reminiscent of Isoran celestial sets. This might seem as an inspiration from a close to Ireland kingdom, a myth and symbol of the sovereignty of Great Britain. But, there are 2 elements to this: the sword is large, larger than any weapon so far discovered, and it has a map of stars: `Etched within the side of the blade appears to be some kind of map of the stars`. The only connection we can derive from it, given sword's size and connection to the stars is the myth of Asgard's construction with the assistance of Giants. The Sword of Freyr comes us to mind, as it was given up in marriage of Freyr with a giantess Ger√∞r.

Here, if we attempt to extrapolate this myth, or merging of 2 myths, it would seem to us as follows.

The sword was made by Valkyries, given the star map, to assist titans in their own work. The sword was sent from the heavens and stuck in a rock, located in [fractured region we have theorized to be the veiled homeland](#veiled-tortodrone-homeland), now identified as Wolver Den, given similar architecture. The sword was never used as it was likely too late for titans, as Undercorp erased them. Given titans' past with, mainly, valkyries, it would seem uncommon for Isorans, even as raiders, to be involved here with giants around the plot of this giant sword.

So far we have proposed a scenario of Isorans being stranded on a planet, which was at some point incorporated into Cradle. Such case seems to us relatively plausible also due to the fact that presence of Clockworks should then be recorder by, at least, people of Almire - based on the position of Haven, Clockwork tunnels are not particularly deep below the ground, which should've been recounted.

##### Location of Firestorm Citadel

Under this notion of relying on norse and irish mythology, we can attempt to establish the location of the Firestorm Citadel based on the proximity to the potentially volcanic mountains, while looking at presence of several kingdoms and Vikings being involved into the conflict.

Among few medieval Irish castles, we consider Firestorm Citadel being potentially inspired by the Rock of Cashel, located in the city of Cashel in Kingdom of Munster near the Galtee Mountains. Kingdom was invaded by U√≠ Imair's army of pagan Vikings. Near it a certain mountain is located - Devil's Bit.

According to the legend, the devil broke his teeth and spat the Rock of Cashel from his mouth to where it stands. The concept of a deity or a beast giving its fang or tooth, then for it being used is common, even of making it into a weapon, this concept is found across many myths.

Here we think of dragons' teeth in the context of western european legends, where teeth would hold symbolic meaning as well as being powerful artifacts.

While this proposal does not completely suffice the setting of Almire, as the themes, found in relation to Devil's Bit does not seem to parallel ours, the general motif of broken teeth and devil is also found here as the [Fang of Vog](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fang_of_Vog), `a sword said to be created from the fang of the fire beast, Vog`.

As it is alchemized from Almirian Seals, it might suggest its involvement with Lord Vanaduke, albeit the same Ancient Armor does not belong to this period of time despite being acquired for Almirian Seals, as we have discussed earlier. Yet, thw sword contains Vog's supposed idea of him both granting power through fire as well as that same fire being detrimental or shadowy even.

Due to this we suggest __Vog being framed as a symbolic dragon perceived by the kingdom of Almire__ though accompanying it motifs. We will see further, that presence of Vog in this period of time might be [deeper](#blackened-shrine-and-magma-deity) than the mountain shrine alone Lord Vanaduke will find.

#### King in The Mountain

As we approach the analysis of Lord Vanaduke himself, we should point out a mythical trope of [king being asleep in the mountains](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingInTheMountain), and returning in a time of kingdom's most need. Of course, in the case of Almire this [subverted](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/PlayingWith/KingInTheMountain) as Lord Vanaduke became the reason for Almire's fall and application of curse.

Here we will present the text of [Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall) in its entirety as well as associated recounts of those events: `The Citadel originates from a war-stricken land of three competing kingdoms. The smallest of the three, known as Almire, was a land of lush, beautiful trees and golden fields. It was ruled by a young and determined king known as Lord Vanaduke, and, despite its small size, Almire was recognized as a powerful nation for its military tradition and disciplined armies. Given time, it could expand to a mighty empire. For this, the other two kings feared him and formed a truce to invade Almire. From atop the highest tower of the Grand Citadel of Almire, Vanaduke watched his kingdom crumble. His army was stretched too thin and it was not long before Almire would completely fall to the weight of the two combined armies. Going mad from the pressure, he fled from the citadel and vanished into the mountains, vowing that he would one day reclaim his throne. Leaving behind his family, his people, and his homeland, Vanaduke journeyed into the mountains to the east, driven by superstitious tales of ancient gods within their dark depths. He tirelessly searched the mountains for many years, no longer the man he was before, but a mad hermit. Then one day he discovered a small cave that radiated with unnatural warmth, smelling of ash and sulfur. Within it he discovered a great chamber whose floor was waist deep in ashes. They were warm, and Vanaduke soon felt the sting of hot coals through his tattered boots. At the center of the chamber was a blackened shrine, whose deity's features were worn and indistinguishable. Vanaduke began to whisper, reciting the names of his family, the names of the kings before him, and all the towns of Almire. He repeated this like a chant, increasing in intensity until he was shouting. With this he began screaming the names of the rival kings and all the wrongs they committed against his kingdom. He cried out to the god of the mountain to punish them, to give him the strength to take his kingdom back. In his frenzy he looked to the face of the deity and in it he began to see the face deform. The image burned into his eyes and brain like cinders, and contained that which sounded like the screaming of foreign tongues and war drums. With this, Vanaduke began to sink into the ash. He choked on the ash as it pulled him below, tasting sulfur his screams now sounding of roaring flames. Many days later the citizens of Almire watched as fire began to erupt from the mountains. Leading an army of terrible fiends, Vanaduke returned to his kingdom, destroying the occupied forces of the two opposing kingdoms in a single day. In time the two kingdoms fell, Vanaduke's legion burning everything in their path. When he returned to Almire, it burned as well, for everywhere he went, and everything he touched was doomed to ash. With nothing left to destroy, his legions left him and returned to the mountains, leaving the king to sit in his throne of ash and cinder, all the people of Almire dead around him. There the cursed king has remained since, ruling a burning kingdom from an ashen throne, surrounded by the lost souls of those that once served him. It is there that the king still mercilessly destroys any who dare enter his kingdom, however much the ashen shadow of what is was the rivers flowed with clear water and the leaves of the trees glittered like emeralds under the shining sun.`

Quoting [Nameless Lost Soul of Almire](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire_(nameless)#Dialogue>): `Lord Vanaduke brought the fire from the mountains to our kingdom. Everything burned. His enemies. Even his family. My family was lost too. I fled the battle as soon as I saw the wave of flames in the distance. I was able to reach my home just in time to see it burn. I don't even remember how it ended. I have no memory of my passing`.

Quoting [Almirian Codex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_codex_text_Dialogue/Inner_Sanctum): `Like so many of its people, Law and Order have fled Almire. Only Justice remains, but she too has been twisted by the cursed flames that ravage our kingdom. Justice is now the burning scepter of our once great Lord Vanaduke. Justice is swift, unflinching, merciless. My position has afforded me much in my life. I used to love the view that my tower offers. From these lofty heights I thought of myself as the first one to greet the spring season, the first to smell the life in the air as the flowers bloomed. Now only death and smoke hang in the air, even from these great heights. And the fires; the unnatural fires that seem to burn eternal, the fires that turn even the most pious men into horrible nightmares, I know that these fires shall soon take me as well. I will not give my former Lord the gift of my own life. It is not his to take, to twist. This shall be my final order. This shall be my Justice`.

This establishes a general timeline of events. Lord Vanaduke fled into the mountains, there he spent _several days_. It is unknown weather Almire at that point had likely fallen under control of the opposing kingdoms.

Meanwhile in the mountains, Lord Vanaduke found a shrine to an unknown deity. It was located in a chamber, whose floor was of ash and burning coals.

This property of shrine's chamber design, with ash and coals present, of course, relates to fire. But this is unknown weather the mountain itself is a volcano or the unnatural warmth is delegated to only this chamber.

As Lord Vanaduke was last described being in the shrine, and as it is recounted by citizens of Almire that fires began to erupt from the mountains, it is likely that the shrine itself was the source of the fires, and a location from which Vanaduke's fiendish army had emerged - the ashen floor and whatever is below. It was mentioned that Vanaduke felt burning coals below the ash - so it seems as if the entirety of the chamber was laid with coal. Could it be a portal, from which fiendish army had emerged? Since we don't have any other places Lord Vanaduke had gone to, it seems very likely.

The wall of flames described to come with Lord Vanaduke, suggest some magic similar to fire snakes seen being cast during th fight. That same cursed fire was capable of transformation into "nightmares" people of Almire - that seems to be the case of a few undead aligning with the Almire. Those undead are ones already discussed in the [crypts section](#crypts): [Slag Walker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zombie#Slag_Walker) and [Carnavon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zombie#Carnavon), [Almirian Shadow Guard](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_Shadow_Guard#Almirian_Shadow_Guard), and [Almirian Crusaders](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_Crusader). Everyone but the first are related to the curse either through the design or ability to inflict it on others.

Yet, they are not the original army of so called fiends, which are stated in the text of Almire's Fall to return with the king, suggesting that this other army came from the shrine, potentially immune to shadow fire, and differs from the undead, transformed by those flames.

We will analyze them in relation to Underworld, as it will be later seen by the implied nature of the Blackened Shrine found by Lord Vanaduke in the mountains.

##### Blackened Shrine and Magma Deity

Before covering Lord Vanaduke's fiendish army, we must establish some connections with the Blackened Shrine itself. We define the name of  Blackened Shrine, based on the text of Almire's Fall: `They were warm, and Vanaduke soon felt the sting of hot coals through his tattered boots. At the center of the chamber was a blackened shrine, whose deity's features were worn and indistinguishable.`

We have a candidate, one fitting both with fiery and curse themes of the deity of the shrine - the unnamed magma god, referred by the magma fanatics, first introduced in the [fiendish cults](#fiendish-cults). It is seen by their design and description: `A plated mail said to have been worn by fanatics that worshiped a magma god. Its fires will protect those that are worthy.` ([Magmatic Fanatic Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail#Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail)). The phrase `Its fires will protect those that are worthy` seem to parallel how Lord Vanaduke and the rest of the Legions of ALmire were burned by flames. Through those flames they were granted cursed immortality, as well as, eventually, resulting in Almire defeating other kingdoms, although in a subverted, cursed and undead state.

Spiral HQ has its own note on the deity, likely being the same: `Even more fun: by burning things while taking on the visage of a fiery deity of martial prowess` ([Fire GOOD!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/111013)). It is unknown, how Spiral Order regained this knowledge, but, based on the earlier discussed [Operation Gelid](#operation-gelid-and-other-methods-of-escaping-cradle), we can suggest that this case might be of similar nature, tracing back to Underworld's influence now onto Spiral Order.

The roster of items describes an entity, a suggested fanatic, who seems to possess a portion of this deity's power:

- `A plated mail said to have been worn by fanatics that worshiped a magma god. Its fires will protect those that are worthy` ([Magmatic Fanatic Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail#Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail)).
- `A mask said to have been worn by fanatics that worshiped a magma god. Its fires will light the path to victory` ([Magmatic Fanatic Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Fanatic_Mask#Magmatic_Fanatic_Mask)).
- [Magmatic Fanatic Wings](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Fanatic_Wings)
- [Magmatic Shackles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Shackles#Magmatic_Shackles)

The design of fanatics' gear is reminiscent of celestial gear of ancient Isorans, but currently we can consider it only as a coincidence.

As for the general theme, as we covered [fiendish cults](#fiendish-cults), we suggest __magmatic fanatics relating to the Magma Deity, and here we can conclude, that this deity's name is Vog__.

It was established, that Vog is not a wolver, but the effects of this deity's power affect all living entities in the similar manner - this includes both Lord Vanaduke's transformation, [magmatic fanatics](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail#Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail) and [vog cubs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vog_Cub#Vog_Cub), and the equipment made of the latter, [Vog Cub Set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vog_Cub_Coat). This set, compared to volcanic armor, has distinct design, identical to all of other manifestations of Vog's influence.

Lord Vanaduke resembles a fiery giant, while the rest of Almirians - Crusaders, Carnavons, and likely Royal Guards, are much less smaller in comparison. The case of guards being far larger than any Isoran can be resolved through an idea of them being skeletal figures, which in folklore and modern fiction are known to possess this property through their assembly and disassembly. We will discuss this concept further in the analysis of [Undead Dreadnoughts](#undead-dreadnoughts).

Then there are vog cubs. There are no present sources of their resemblance, but, as based on the equipment, made from their hides - the [Vog Cub set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vog_Cub_Coat), - they seem to also possess same volcanic characteristics, as this set has the same blazing cracked pattern. The Vog Cub set being an upgrade of [Ash Tail set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ash_Tail_Coat) also _allows us to draw parallels with_ [frostifurs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Perma_Frostifur#Frostifur) and [Perma-Frostifurs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Perma_Frostifur#Perma-Frostifur) _as both in differing capacity seem to align to the Hail Deity_, as discuss in the [influences of Underworld](#influences-of-underworld).

The title of a deity, for the simplicity, we can attribute to Vog as a continuation of the naming convention [stated by Nick](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/9995#comment-55776) - `The great fire beast Vog isn't a wolver himself, but a fiery deity of sorts who embraces some creatures and grants them a bit of power. Vog's 'cubs' are more or less acquired and forced to spread his fiery love across the world. The Snarbolax has no relation to Vog`, - a fire beast-deity Vog, and by the evidence of him possessing fangs: `A sword said to be created from the fang of the fire beast, Vog` ([Fang of Vog](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fang_of_vog)). But, as we discussed earlier the motif of a medieval dragon, we can also suggest this item, the Fang of Vog, belonging not to the Vog himself, but his manifestation in material realm, a wolver, perhaps?

It has the same cracked design while being constantly in flames, which, due to tricky nature of the deity, is also detrimental to its wielder.

Finally, the [Vog slippers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Vog_Slippers-Equipped.png) of the [Cozy Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cozy_Prize_Box) depict vog cubs as fire-themed wolvers with glowing muzzle and burning tail.

It is important to note that the heavenly kingdom is located above magma-covered mountains: `A helm worm by heavenly guardians who watch over a kingdom hidden atop a magma-covered mountain` ([Raging Avenger Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raging_Avenger_Helm)). Does this mean that the mountain in question is the same one the blackened shrine is located?

Throughout Almire's war with neighboring kingdoms, Valkyries of heavenly kingdom had remained uninvolved, given lack of any their presence. They did not intervene with the war, but, we suggest, that at some point, with the introduction of fiendish magic, they had to take measures. Those measure eventually resulted in the banishment of Legion of Ur into the Underworld. We bring up them here due to a later event of Lord Vanaduke returning from the mountains with a fiendish army.

We can reason why valkyries haven't intervene, as in case of Undercorp's erasure of Titans, and a plausible explanation could be one where events of this chapter had happened on a remote planet, separate from heavenly kingdom. But, there is existence of Owlites, who had surpassed valkyrian divine magic, and studied the kingdom of Almire - which would seem  unfitting be both Owlites alive already on Cradle.

We now have to return to the nature of the mountain itself. We believe that the mountain in question, one that houses the shrine, is indeed a volcano by following thematic parallels:

- Presence of volcanic armor which utilizes volcanic iron as well as fiery souls - and as we discussed, both concept are not of material realm, by concept of souls. It is a volcano in the name, essentially.
- Inner Sanctum of Legion of Almire is most reminiscent of excavated remains of the city of Pompeii, which had fallen to a volcano.

Aforementioned relation to fire deity and ashen remains of the Legion of Almire may bring up a potential inspiration behind Vog, apart from being named such from volcanic fog, a concept of volcanic deity, specifically, roman god Vulcan. Vulcan is also associated with metalwork, which could be represented by the volcanic armor, and someone forging this plated armor with the elemental knowledge.

Apart from Vulcan, a potential inspiration for the setting could be Japanese Fujisan Sengen Shrine located in the foothills of Mount Fuji.

Not only it is located in the volcanic mountain, enshrining Kamuatatsu-hime - goddess of water keeping volcano from erupting, and is associated with water springs. Both volcanic and water themes are present in Almire, as well as fit into a potential geography of Almire, being located in the foothills with water springs from the mountain, given how Lord Vanaduke had resorted to this myth in the mountains.

This concept of a deity or a guardian is similar to Isoran myth of an Oni in the mountains: `Designed to frighten their enemies, this helm is in the visage of a fiend who lives in the mountains of a distant land. Said to guard the gate to heaven itself, it only allows those who are worthy to pass` ([Oni Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Oni_Helm)). This seems to us a very strong parallel to the perceived through retellings legend, due to which Lord Vanaduke departed into the mountains in the first place: `Going mad from the pressure, he fled from the citadel and vanished into the mountains, vowing that he would one day reclaim his throne. Leaving behind his family, his people, and his homeland, Vanaduke journeyed into the mountains to the east, driven by superstitious tales of ancient gods within their dark depths. He tirelessly searched the mountains for many years, no longer the man he was before, but a mad hermit` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall)).

It seems plausible to us, that Almire, while it held power over land, and as it developed, __it unearthed the volcanic iron and flame souls deep in the mountains__. And, by being a medieval kingdom, one potentially aware of other realms, at least of Spirit Mother's realm, it is _plausible for it eventually to discover Underworld in the generally similar manner as Tortomega once did_.

Through those discoveries, kept within the mountain, armor was made, forged from the volcanic iron. And, at the same time a __connection with Vog was established in the mountain, which can explain presence of both Blackened Shrine and Magma Fanatics__.

##### Discovery of Vile Deity

We can also suggest that near this time an unknown Vile fiendish entity was found, as seen in [Venom Fiend Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Venom_Fiend_Mask#Venom_Fiend_Mask): `A mask said to be crafted in the visage of a venomous fiend. It is infused with a vile essence that is sure to frighten your foes`, and its similarity to the Magma Deity.

While being mainly a speculation, it proposes an explanation for this similarity as follows: _as Almire was at war, it can be plausible for the people of Almire to search for far more drastic measures_, and, as discussed in the [graveyards section](#graveyards), eventually someone would attempt to tap into the occult. A contact with the Underworld would be established, discovering the Vile Deity.

This seems more possible if we take in consideration, that _Lord Vanaduke had originally sought after the mountains due to a legend or a tale_: `Vanaduke journeyed into the mountains to the east, driven by superstitious tales of ancient gods within their dark depths.` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall)). In that proposal, graveyards did remain the same, but the occult practices around them were now present.

The graveyards are present as the [necropolis grounds](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire/Necropolis_Grounds) where Almirian army was buried and contain [Almirian tombs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-Graveyard_1.png), _we can conclude, that graveyards belong to the kingdom of Almire_. Both the necropolis and tombs we can find lingering, seemingly devilite activity:

- Near the necropolis have an occasional [Almirian tomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-Graveyard_variant.jpg) is found empty with shadow fires still burning in presence of cursed warrior.
- In the necropolis, Devilite sigils and shadow fires are present near the tombs in the final arena of the [Necropolis Grounds](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire/Necropolis_Grounds).

But, as for whoever was drawing the sigils, we do not know. A potential lead in that regard, but one that seems more of an asset reuse - is presence of devilite sigil-like patterns on the Water Fountain in the court of the Firestorm Citadel.

On the other hand, we know that some actor was summoning Black Kats - `Someone or something has summoned a horde of cursed Black Kats into the Clockworks` ([Kataclysmic Confrontation](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kataclysmic_Confrontation)), - could this culprit be also found here? We will remember this theme of an unknown figure, as we will return to it in the [chapter on Kat Tribe](#chapter-viii-kat-tribe).

#### Legion of Ur

It is stated that Lord Vanaduke had returned from the mountains with a fiendish army: `Many days later the citizens of Almire watched as fire began to erupt from the mountains. Leading an army of terrible fiends, Vanaduke returned to his kingdom, destroying the occupied forces of the two opposing kingdoms in a single day. In time the two kingdoms fell, Vanaduke's legion burning everything in their path. When he returned to Almire, it burned as well, for everywhere he went, and everything he touched was doomed to ash. With nothing left to destroy, his legions left him and returned to the mountains, leaving the king to sit in his throne of ash and cinder, all the people of Almire dead around him` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall)).

_The one army that seems to be otherworldly and made up of fiends is the Legion of Ur_. Moreover, we find trojans across the Firestorm Citadel. But, how do they fit to the established timeline? Did Spiral Order take Legion of Ur as inspiration and a design for spiral wardens? There are many links to them starting to pile up from previous chapters of our analysis. In this section and discussion, we intend to understand them.

In the previous section [we concluded](#blackened-shrine-and-magma-deity), that __fire deity Vog is the Magma Deity, he has his cult and a shrine within the mountain under reign of Almire__. Due to looming themes of fire over nature and water-themed Almire, we suggested, that volcanic iron as well as volcanic, plated armor was of Almire's design, contributing to its military power, - tied to the inner workings of the kingdom and application of mountain's heat. There, in the depths of the mountain, the deity would be found.

And, through this connection to the Underworld, we considered it a fiend inhabiting the Underworld, in the similar manner to the earlier introduced notions of Hail and Vile Deities. We have also discussed, that this fiendish army, which had accompanied Lord Vanaduke in his return, did emerge from the erupting fires of the mountain, reminiscent of a volcano, and, as mentioned, city of Pompeii. There, as Lord Vanaduke was last known to sink into [shrine's ash](#blackened-shrine-and-magma-deity), we proposed, that its floor of coals was a portal to Underworld, from which eventually a fiendish army would emerge.

Lord Vanaduke is not Undead, given his cursed state, but a fiend-like entity seemingly animated by curse, which, considering presence of shadow damage and undead animated by his powers, is not native to the material realm.

This makes us think of the many connections to the Underworld, proposing that Legion of Ur is that fiendish army, which Vanaduke led from the mountains, as the theme of a connection to it, both through Vanaduke and the fact no other powerful legion is currently known to exist seems solid enough reason to make that conclusion.

In the modern times Legion of Ur is sealed in the Underworld, we suggest that this legion was sealed as means of preventing any more large scale rampages, due to legion's immense power as stated: `Vanaduke returned to his kingdom, destroying the occupied forces of the two opposing kingdoms in a single day. In time the two kingdoms fell, Vanaduke's legion burning everything in their path` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall)).

Then it is [Crest of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crests_of_Ur) which contains an addition to this power of the legion: `A crest from the lost Legion of Ur, an elite band of fiendish warrior said to have once conquered the Underworld. Whomever holds it can faintly hear the sound of drums and the clomping of hooves`.

##### Almirian Empire

Setting aside designs of curse within Vanaduke, Darkfire Lord Vanaduke, and nature of dark matter within trojans, we should point out the following arrangement of concepts - _spookats and zombies do belong to different epochs separated by thousand of years_. And yet, both zombies and spookats ended up in the Owlite ruins of the High Academy, which is part of heavenly kingdom.

Spookats are explained through a future war of [Kat Tribe and Owlites](#chapter-viii-kat-tribe), but presence of zombies are not. Moreover, summoned _Black Kats are capable of summoning cursed Almirian warriors - Carnavons_.

We suggest that at some point in time, Vanaduke had a conflict with heavenly kingdom, wherein Owlites and valkyries were present. Graveyards, in that regard do belong to Almirian territories, as discussed earlier, by the presence of Almirian tombs.

This hypothesis may be also hinted by a specific wording in the monster codex - kingdom of Almire is referred by the monster codex of Lord Vanaduke in his Throne Room, as an Empire: `Little is known about the eternal Duke of the Almirian Empire.` ([Monstrous Codex: Lord Vanaduke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vanaduke#About)).

Could it be, that the kingdom of Almire did become an empire the size of the 3 warring kingdoms after Lord Vanaduke destroyed their armies - it was stated in the text of Almire's Fall - `It was ruled by a young and determined king known as Lord Vanaduke, and, despite its small size, Almire was recognized as a powerful nation for its military tradition and disciplined armies` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall))?

At the same time the reference to Almire as an Empire only once could be an oversight. The possibility of this being an oversight may be also affirmed by the fact Lord Vanaduke had returned to the citadel: `With nothing left to destroy, his legions left him and returned to the mountains, leaving the king to sit in his throne of ash and cinder, all the people of Almire dead around him. There the cursed king has remained since, ruling a burning kingdom from an ashen throne` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall)).

Yet, the recount of those events itself seems to come from an observer, seemingly present there, observing those events and aware of the blackened shrine, returning to the [diegesis of this lore entry](#diegesis-of-almires-fall). While the existence of an empire is still questionable, the connection, even through curse, of Black Kats and Carnavons is something to remember in relation to the nature of curse.

##### Trojans

Prime thing to establish regarding trojans is to _determine weather or not they are Isoran Spiral Wardens_ - as it is one of more lasting debates that tie in with the idea of Isorans being connected in some capacity to Cradle. How this, _parallel of roles_, of __trojans being an elite force of Underworld__, and __Wardens being prime guardians of the Order__ through the Guardian's Oath, match?

Trojans of tier 2 and deeper all have revealed bones most visible at their skulls, and, what is no less important - horse skulls, with lower jaws, similar to apparitions of giant wolver of charged [Wild Hunting Blade](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wild_Hunting_Blade), [Perma-Frostifurs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver#Perma-Frostifur), and [Void Wolvers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver#Void_Wolver). This seems as an intentional design choice, although unrelated to the Void specifically. This undead direction culminates in tier 3 trojans, whose armor has depictions of skulls, and their internals, ribcage hidden behind chest plate seem to burn with purple flame, the stone of their heads shattered completely, revealing a fully-formed horse skull.

It is said that lazy devilites eventually transform into gorgos: `Gorgos are bulbous fiends who are constantly on the lookout for their next meal. Within the Underworld they are among the lowest in the fiendish pecking order and are used as a twisted form of motivation for white collar devilites. For those that don't work hard every day will eventually become a terrible gorgo; their bodies bloating and their two eyes forming into one, because why waste all that extra energy blinking both?` ([Release Notes: 2013.05.01](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2013-05-01)). Herein also lies Lord Vanaduke, by the fact of him being transformed, although by a curse, into an immortal fiery giant.

As a matter of fact, significant transformation while is rare, does exist as a concept, judging not by devilites, but Lord Vanaduke alone, as _no other species so far look similar to Lord Vanaduke's physique, apart from Maulos, - a trojan_.

We can hypothesize that trojans are transformed Spiral Wardens, as under current framework, wardens had to end up on that planet, preceding Cradle and rest of civilization.

Tier 1 trojans and the rest are explicitly seen as stone statues. In fact, trojans are encountered for the first time as [statues in the final room](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:BOTF.png) of [Soldier's Graveyard](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blades_of_the_Fallen/Soldier%27s_Graveyard) during [Blades of The Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blades_of_the_Fallen): `Not every knight who enters the Clockworks returns to feel the sun on their face once more. Within the perilous depths of the Clockworks, those that brave its dangers always face the reality that every expedition may be their last. Sometimes their bodies can be recovered and other times all that is left is the remnants of their gear. Just outside of Haven, Spiral HQ has built a soldier's graveyard where fallen knights can lay to rest. As a Spiral Knight, you must face the reality of death in order to understand its gravity. Deliver the remains of an unknown knight, a sword, to a memorial within the graveyard. But stay alert- dark energies resonate from the graveyard, attracted to the countless souls it houses`.

Another instance of trojans being statues is the [Cryptic Statuary](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cryptic_Statuary) - a castle, reminiscent of both Scarlet Fortress and Royal Jelly Palace with its pools of water in the courtyards while being located outside of the main mass of Scarlet Fortress, but with Scarlet Fortress tapestry remaining.

_Across all tiers, trojans have dark matter mineral embedded in their backs_, and as depth increases, so its effects being more explicit. Notably, Tier 1 trojans have wooden armor, and considering there is existence of ironwood fantasy-themed application, we can suggest that it is redwood, due to its color.

The crest of their shields present on tier 1 trojans may potentially refer to Ironmight crest, mainly based on the idea that a tower depicted on all Scarlet Fortress tapestries is emblem of Heavenly Kingdom.

Mentioned only now, there is a vague notion of [chess-themed hierarchy found across all of the species](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chess_Mini), designed to fit into the [Guild Hall](#guild-hall-and-spiral-order-headquarters).

As for the burning, while the color is a hue of purple or pink, there are other instances of that type of burning being observed. Those are Carnavons, Darkfire Lord Vanaduke and the [Dark Embers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember), which are `salvaged from Lord Vanaduke's throne room.` ([Dark Ember](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember)), and purple orbs of light across Moorcroft Manor and Shadow Firestorm Citadel.

Before making one rather [significant suggestion](#nature-of-darkfire) with its implications regarding dark embers, we should cover [Arkus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arkus), as a __single Isoran, who bridges the gap between trojans and Spiral Wardens__.

##### Silent Legion

Among Isorans, [Arkus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arkus) is the one who has a strong connection to trojans, although nature of this connections is unknown, it is one we should try to identify. This may potentially reveal more about trojans' nature and greater Legion of Ur.

Arkus is supposedly the only one surviving an attack of dust zombies with the rest of his squad perishing: `Arkus's own squad perished in a grisly battle with a horde of dust zombies. Since then, Arkus has blamed himself for their loss, saying that he betrayed his Guardian's Oath to protect his squad` ([The Silent Legion](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Silent_Legion)). While an approximation of this ambush, being Graveyards, Clockwork Tunnels, Candlestick Keep, Ruined Compounds and Arenas, is unknown, considering that Arkus ended up in the Statuary, as he was called there - `I am drawn to this place. ... I have been asked to let it go, to move on, but this I cannot do. Their faces, their dying cries... they haunted me in my dreams, so I no longer sleep. Now I see them when I close my eyes, so I shall not blink. I will remain here, among the stones... never blinking, never forgetting` ([Recon Module: Cryptic Statuary - Arkus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Silent_Legion/Cryptic_Statuary)), - we can attempt to further analyze the state he is found in through different means.

Arkus' search and rescue mission - [The Silent Legion](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Silent_Legion), - has several symbolic elements.

The Silent Legion of mission's card is depicted as trojans while they are encased in stone, hence 3rd depth on the mission - Cryptic Statuary, a place for statues.

This establishes as _connection between trojan Legion of Ur_ and the _Silent Legion of stone trojans_.

The distinction here, we believe, stems from the fact that Legion of Ur is active to this day, despite being sealed in the Underworld, while the Silent Legion of trojans is present in the material realm, encased in stone.

And yet, once their break free of stone, they behave essentially as any other member of Legion of Ur.

We don't know their motivation at that point, but few potential hints may be found - some _statues in the Cryptic Statuary on being hit become trojans, while trojans, once defeated, turn to stone_ - this ties in in yet unexplored nature of trojans.

First and second depths are "Poisoned Minds" and "Cold Hearts".

This seems to us as most prominent symbolism in regards to the Silent Legion. If we to interpret those two by reference to multiple minds and hearts, with a high certainty we can attribute it to the Silent Legion.

Cold hearts are generally accepted as as [unfeeling or uncaring, "cold-hearted"](https://www.theidioms.com/cold-hearted/). Trojans are turned to stone at that point, so it could be a metaphor for stone, as both stone cold, and relentless in their goals.

_The poisoned minds are more nuanced_, it is not a singular mind, which in that case would mean Arkus, but it refers to the _entire legion_, and maybe, the way it affects Arkus, too, - by poisoning his mind as rest of trojans. In case of legionnaires - who is the perpetrator of this plot, if we to read it literally?

Considering presence of devilites, similar to how they were found in the [Gauntlet during Shock and Awe](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gauntlet#Gate_Map), as well inside the [penultimate arena during Last Stand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Gauntlet/Last_Stand), could it be, that devilites are indeed involved in the creation of the Legion?

We believe that is true, - _devilites are involved in the creation of the Legion of Ur_, but how? Considering that there is no other party powerful enough to perform such feats in relation to curses and haunting.

Given [Crest of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crest_of_Ur) description - `A crest from the lost Legion of Ur, an elite band of fiendish warrior said to have once conquered the Underworld. Whomever holds it can faintly hear the sound of drums and the clomping of hooves`, - _Legion of Ur was not always known to Underworld_, before their conquest.

Notably, __one who hold the crest, hears drums. The same phenomenon was mentioned during Almire's Fall__: `The image burned into his eyes and brain like cinders, and contained that which sounded like the screaming of foreign tongues and war drums` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall)).

Could it be, that _the same fiendish transformation had taken place for whoever were to become trojans_?

##### Haunting

What happened to Arkus by the time Spiral Knights had met him? For that we have to analyze Arkus himself, and his dialogue.

- `I am drawn to this place. In the eyes of these silent warriors I see myself: cold, strong, unflinching... and crumbling. I have been asked to let it go, to move on, but this I cannot do. Their faces, their dying cries... they haunted me in my dreams, so I no longer sleep. Now I see them when I close my eyes, so I shall not blink. I will remain here, among the stones... never blinking, never forgetting.` ([Arkus - Recon Module: Cryptic Statuary](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arkus#Dialogue)).

    From this entry we can establish basic premise of what has happened to Arkus since his squad had perished.

    Arkus is supposedly haunted by memory of his squad's last moments, and through this, he was for some reason, drawn to the statuary.

    Weather this haunting is literal, or a result of a trauma, is yet to be analyzed.
- `I could swear I heard them just now, their voices carrying in the wind. No longer screams, no longer cries- whispers. Indecipherable even in the stillness of this place` ([Arkus - Cryptic Statuary](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Silent_Legion/Cryptic_Statuary)).

    When Spiral Knight caught up to him, he advised to leave him, and during the second encounter he told no more voices were haunting him.

Dark matter itself is stated to `contain the essences of both chaos and nothingness` ([Dark Matter](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mineral#Dark_Matter)), but shadow damage is more precise: `Shadow damage is generally caused by concentrations of negative energy. Attacks that inflict shadow damage include anything from the psychic manipulation of the aforementioned negative energy to physical attacks using weapons forged from dark matter` ([The Shadow Knows - Hahn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Shadow_Knows)). The part involving `psychic manipulation` is what important to us - how it through laws of this Universe related to dark matter? Is it that distilled chaos or nothingness of dark matter within weapons being weaponized and directed, as a sort of _mental or even metaphysical assault onto ones' soul_, taken conscious and living beings are weak to it?

This theme of madness from presence of dark matter, is introduced in detail in [Acheron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Acheron): `this dark weapon has been known to drive weak-minded knights to the brink of madness`, and, partially, [Obsidian Edge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Edge): `A sinister sword made from the obsidian obelisks found within the realm of the Apocrea. Simply holding it makes you somehow feel guilty of an unknown crime`. Despite the latter being an eldritch brandish, both are initially alchemized from the 3-star [Nightblade](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nightblade): `A short slicer infused with the essence of the Underworld`.

In continuation of the theme of silence, the [Silent Nightblade](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silent_Nightblade) is described as `Crafted with some of the most devilish materials found on Cradle, this inky blade can explode with fiendish fury`. The only material added to the recipe compared to its 3-star version is the [Ghost Bell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghost_Bell), an undead-themed material while the rest are fiend-themed. [Ghost Bell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghost_Bell) is described as `A small silvery bell worn by considerate ghosts that alerts the living when they are nearby` which is an antonym of silence, and the theme of the bell itself is one of declaring death:

<BookCitation source="John Donne - No Man Is an Island">
  {#snippet markup()}

  No man is an island,

  Entire of itself.

  Each is a piece of the continent,

  A part of the main.

  If a clod be washed away by the sea,

  Europe is the less.

  As well as if a promontory were.

  As well as if a manor of thine own

  Or of thine friend's were.

  Each man's death diminishes me,

  For I am involved in mankind.

  Therefore, send not to know

  For whom the bell tolls,

  It tolls for thee.

  {/snippet}
</BookCitation>

The shadow damage itself, it is stated by [Spiral Order biotech Hahn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hahn), that `shadow damage is generally caused by concentrations of negative energy. Attacks that inflict shadow damage include anything from the psychic manipulation of the aforementioned negative energy to physical attacks using weapons forged from dark matter` ([The Shadow Knows - Hahn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Shadow_Knows)).

This property is similar to effects of dark matter-alchemized weapons, connecting the two. Considering the unreliability of Arkus as a narrator, it may seem unknown weather Arkus is haunted by the souls of his squad or is driven mad by the presence of dark matter, as there are no definitive evidence for the prior, and no cases of souls or spirits haunting living Isorans. Yet we can't deny the fact that spirits do return to material realm across Clockworks, and their effects on the material realm are rather vague, as well as they were seen in the material realm in such cases as Lost Souls during Shroud of Apocrea.

If the above scenario is true, - of Arkus being haunted, - then this presents a scenario, in its uniqueness similar to the [Ghosts in the Machine](#ghosts-in-the-machine), as they communicate with the living. The aspect of benevolence can be seen here. As in the Iron Hulk, those souls, trapped in the machine were helping the knight. Here, either they or Spiral HQ asks Arkus to leave those feelings behind - `In the eyes of these silent warriors I see myself: cold, strong, unflinching... and crumbling. I have been asked to let it go, to move on, but this I cannot do` ([Recon Module: Cryptic Statuary - Arkus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Silent_Legion/Cryptic_Statuary)), and then the voices themselves seemingly leave Arkus: `I could swear I heard them just now, their voices carrying in the wind. No longer screams, no longer cries- whispers. Indecipherable even in the stillness of this place. Are they leaving me here? Why must I be left behind?` ([Cryptic Statuary - Arkus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Silent_Legion/Cryptic_Statuary)).

And for the case of spirits remaining in the material realm, one item presents itself with the direct mention of haunting - the 5-star [Dread Skelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Skelly_Shield): `It occasionally issues a quiet, forlorn whisper, usually about remembering to block` and its earlier version, 4-star [Sinister Skelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sinister_Skelly_Shield): `A kite shield haunted by a benevolent ghost`.

Those two items make us conclude on the scenario of __Arkus being haunted__ by lingering souls or their afterimages, of his squad. This concept of lingering will be further explored [in relation to Lord Vanaduke](#vanadukes-mask-and-immortality-span-classthrough-cursethrough-cursespan).

##### Spiral Wardens and Trojans Similarity: Part 1

Apart from those effects of dark matter, we need to establish a more defined nature of Arkus's physical state and relation to trojans through the analysis of other, more prominent, physical effect of dark matter.

What are the conditions of Arkus' transformation to a trojan? Is _dark matter being here a consequence or means of the transformation_? What part of this process is supposed to be symbolic in the first place, - for example, how Arkus is a Spiral Warden, has warden's horse helmet and trojans having similar horse appearance and a physical horse skull underneath the stone exterior of the helm as revealed in tier 2 and 3 trojan designs?

To resolve this, tortodrones could be reintroduced. They are reactivated with the dark matter crystals as a power source. In order to power tortodrone with dark matter, its shell is deconstructed, and on its plates fiendish sigils are carved in place of evil eyes, potentially made of dark matter due to their glow and other instance of ritual circles of dark matter.

It was already explored, how devilites may use those sigils, concluding to them being a [protective and summoning, utility measure](#ritual-circles-circle-of-art-pentacles).

Tortodrones' case suggests that _some intervention had to happen, in order to place dark matter_. On the other hand, there are Lord Vanaduke, zombies and Carnavons, _who got the familiar purple glow through the cursed transformation_, mainly claws and inner glow of eyes and ribcage. In case of Arkus, as he is an Isoran, could've he gone through a similar process of potential death, as carnavons, or transfiguring curse, as Lord Vanaduke?

Here we have to bring up the case of devilite involvement, as they are usually ones responsible for Underworld-related activities across Clockworks. _They are encountered in the Call of the Colossi_ as well as in the _Amu-Sol during the event of Heart of Ice_. They were present during _summoning of trojans from the legion of Ur_, and were _present in the Gauntlet alongside gremlins_.

And despite all of those instances, they are absent in the Cryptic Statuary. From native fiends there are only [Beryl Greavers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Beryl_Greaver) and trojans themselves.

And yet, both trojans, and devilites did come from the underworld at least on Cradle. Moreover, Arkus is accompanied by greavers, from whom the entire history of Undercorp in the material realm had begun.

##### Greavers

Greavers in that context are rather important entities. They have evil eye wing patterns, similar to moths, and in case of elemental greavers, those patterns glow.

As it was already covered in the [Arrival of Undercorp chapter](#chapter-vi-arrival-of-undercorp), Greavers seem to be Underworld's military units, judging by the presence of a [shadow steel helm with a evil eye](#evil-eye) and the exact specie from which imagery of the evil eye started to spread across planet of material realm, which was then incorporated into Cradle.

What their name means, symbolically? In a same manner as howlitzer are reminiscent of howitzers, could greavers be attributed to anything militaristic? First, there are greaves - a type of leg armour. This can potentially mean that __greavers are indeed an elite military units__. _We saw this first-hand in fiendish arenas_, where 12 Greavers, which are considered elite enemies, approach as the [final wave of the final arena starts](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arena#Final_Wave_3).

We had suggested an inspiration behind greavers' design being moths. Apart from a similar shape and wing patterns, they play a significant role in greek mythology. Moths were believed to be carriers or be guidance for souls. Apart from it, Arkus's fight is one of a few instance of a text or Spiral Knight narrating over the events: `An intense sadness radiates from his fallen form. His eys fade and a darkness washes over him. Arkus is lost.` ([Arkus - inspection](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arkus)).

Could it be, that during Arkus's fight in the Cryptic Statuary greavers serve role of a soul being departed? Moreover, considering all of the known logic and manipulation of souls, could it be that we have witnessed __Underworld's method of capturing souls__, paralleling Apocrean Harvester, as both are insect-like creatures?

#### Minerals and Souls: Part 3 - Mineral Charge

Sparks of life, or rather, an emergency revive, _supercharges dark matter shard in Arkus_, forming small arcs of purple lightning on the first revive around the crystal. On the second revive, those _arcs are seen all throughout Arkus's armor_.

The last stages in that regard resemble tier 3 trojans, as both do have a characteristic purple crystal fuming, and lightning. Arkus' dark matter shard, same as trojans', glows pink and burns with the same purple flame, not seen before initial revive.

__This property of burning after a revive in mineral seems to us as a depiction of its now charged state.__

To cycle back to tortofists' ammo - there is potentially only other one instance of charged dark matter - the bullets of [Gorgofist](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgofist). In that case the crystals are the same color as pillars but have bright purple pulsing glow as the rest of tortofists' ammo.

Throughout [Minerals and Souls](#minerals-and-souls-part-1), [Auras and Souls](#auras-and-souls), and [Apocrean Engines](#apocrean-engines) we had suggested, that __minerals under some conditions could contain charge made of souls__, _essentially the Energy in a specific form._

The Energy here being the medium for souls to exist in and through, and a link for the fuel of [Apocrean Engines](#apocrean-engines) under condition of being captured by the latter. That energy is contained in minerals as charge, one used to power Clockwork Gates, as suggested by Vaelyn's team technician: `We need to analyze how mineral power affects the Core. The problem is that very little power reaches down to these depths. We can gather so much data from each gate as it launches`. Although, this dialogue could potentially refer to an old method of gate construction, as it had remained unchanged after rework of energy system. But since the dialogue is in the game, and talks about gate launches themselves, we may also suggest a role of energy here being used as-is - _an originally diegetic component of the game_, not intended to be removed as it sheds light on the actual physics of minerals, despite the latter being merged with the current concept of Energy in a seemingly non-diegetic manner.

As no souls exit minerals, unlike everfrost, it is likely that it is rather a different form of energy contained within those minerals.

As mineral pillars are explicitly placed and stored across Clockworks, we can potentially suggest, that those are in the depleted state. It is then a question of why gremlins had to store specifically depleted mineral?

There is presence of dark matter in a more raw formations such as [across dark cities](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Area-Devilish_Drudgery-Scenario_Room5A.png), and around tortodrone-themed arenas. On the other hand, those could be shards of tortodrone missiles in a more cinematic perspective. Lastly, given those minerals are also observed in the arenas as being hidden behind Misery Blocks, we may propose that it is the most natural state dark matter is found in - in large chunks of mineral compared to the mineral pillars.

##### Instances of Charge

Now we cycle back to tortodrones, but in the context of souls. What connects tortodrones, trojans, and Arkus, is that all have dark matter present, it serves as, potentially, a power source, and is charged to the point of fuming/burning:

- Tortodrones have cracked shells with purple glow, purple lightning arcs and burning eyes.

    Crimsonite-powered tortodrones don't have burning eyes, but do have red lightning arcs throughout their shells.

    When a corrupted, or potentially, any tortodrone is defeated:

    - Its power pistons extend and purple mist is released, similar to mist of tier 2 trojans, attributed to [Baleful Aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Baleful_Aura#Baleful_Aura).
    - Tortodrone petrifies. Their shells and perceived bodies are made of stone and capable of being completely destroyed, once tortodrone deactivates.
    - The glyphs, carved on each individual shell of tortodrone stop glowing.
- Trojans, especially tier 3 have their internals, ribcage and eyes, seemingly cracked as stone and burning with the same brighter hue of purple-pink fire and visible lightning arcs.

    Their dark matter crystal on the back burns as well and is the same bright pink color, identical to Arkus at his first revive.

    When trojan is defeated, his crystal shatters, multiple purple explosions happen, and trojan petrifies.
- Arkus has the same dark matter crystal, with the first revive it starts to burn as well as emit arcs of purple lightning.

    With the second revive purple lightnings arcs traverse entirety of Arkus's armor.

    When Arkus is defeated, no shattered crystal is seen, but the purple explosions remain. Arkus does not turn to stone.
- Maulos has the same armour with skull imagery, ribcage, and revealed skull for a head as tier 3 trojans.

    He has everfrost instead of dark matter embedded, and has moonstone-like glow from the ribcage, but no burning flames. Presence of everfrost in place of dark matter was the foundational element for this soul-energy link within minerals.

    What sets him apart from trojans is the presence of everfrost onto his skull, forming a vertical spike. When he is defeated, the everfrost shard shatters with its distinct color.

All of those patterns seem to point a specificity of dark matter and by extension, everfrost, being connected, but also having similar underlying nature and effects.

To reiterate on [Minerals and Souls part 1 conclusion](#minerals-and-souls-part-1), those properties emerging from a connection to dark matter seem as one of arguments to energy in some capacity being contained in minerals. But then, this _leads to questioning if everfrost is a subtype of moonstone_, be it Underworld counterpart, or a changed by souls of Blinding Abyss moonstone? This currently is unknown. But, as it is _capable of growing from Maulos's ribcage_, we have to point out the nature of Darkfire Lord Vanaduke's and Carnavon's __claws - made of dark matter, as if transformed__.

Could it be, that __dark matter shard on trojans backs is a symptom, rather than a reason for their condition__?

Those aspects of both presence of dark matter and curse will be iterated upon in our [final analysis of curse](#intermission-analysis-of-curse).

##### Metaphysics of Souls and <span class="through-curse">Cursed Immortality</span>

As zombies are resurrected, as _Carnavons and Lord Vanaduke are animated by curse, which grants them immortality_, what have happened to Arkus, and by extension, Maulos, and the Legion of Ur to become fiends?

As far as information about Arkus claims, he could have metaphorically died back then and be brought back to life through curse, similar to the [crew of Iron Hulk](#ghosts-in-the-machine), as they _haunt the ship and bodies as undead_, or, more likely, as _Lord Vanaduke on the altar of a volcanic deity_. Apart from the transformation being seemingly caused by the _sheer grief and exposure to Underworld_ to be a reason, we have to search further, while assuming such case.

In case of the [Ghost in The Machine](#ghosts-in-the-machine) the spirits, which could communicate, were benevolent.

Trojans were _sealed in the Underworld and then summoned_, and _Maulos is summoned from Underworld or even Blinding Abyss_. Maulos brought influence of everfrost with him and is _transformed by its presence_ - or by being in the Blinding Abyss, - when compared to trojans of Legion of Ur, who are also transformed, but accompanied by presence of dark matter.

Carnavons, potentially Slag Walkers, and the rest of Almire's legion were scorched by shadow fires of Lord Vanaduke, as he returned from the mountains. _This does not explicitly mean death_, as souls of Almirians remain trapped - more about it now.

In that sense, we suggest, that presence of fiery souls after Firestorm Citadel' was partially cleansed by the waters from [Spirit Mother's Realm](#spirit-mothers-realm) and Vanaduke's defeat, may reveal that _they were trapped in a corporeal form of perished or ashen Almirians_, in a similar manner as Lord Vanaduke is described by the [Lost Soul of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire_(nameless)): `Lord Vanaduke rules over the citadel now. His soul bound to some horrific armored prison. ... Allow the souls he keeps bound to this world a chance to return` ([Alone in The Dark - Lost Souls of Almire](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire_(nameless)#Dialogue>)). __That it is not the metaphysic of Cradle, which do not permit his soul to leave, but the curse itself__.

Souls are bound to the citadel, which burns as long as Lord Vanaduke is alive. The quote `His soul bound to some horrific armored prison` here, we believe, has 2 interpretations:

- Less of a reference to the citadel, but to Vanaduke's armor itself, as the armor itself seems unnatural, transforming with the Lord, and by presence of word "some", which in the context of the entire dialogue seems to us as a reference to a different object.
- Referring to the Citadel itself. Once Lord Vanaduke is defeated, Nature Sprites had regained power to put out the fire: `Firestorm Citadel continues to burn with accursed flames. Though the nature sprites have been steadily making progress in fighting the flames, something or someone has recently caused a violent resurgence in its destructive power` ([Shadowplay](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay)).

    As the most of citadel is cleansed, the souls, mentioned in the quote `Allow the souls he keeps bound to this world a chance to return`, are present as [Fire Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fire_Soul#Fire_Soul) in the [Overgrown Court](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Overgrown_Court).

    Despite metaphysical state of Cradle, could it be, that the departure of souls is permitted, but, the other way around - their entrance - is this unnatural phenomenon?

This setup and physics, on the other hand, contradict presence of souls in the [Dry Docks](#ghosts-in-the-machine). The problem, as we see it, stems from the fact souls of Almire are being released from the curse, which had them bound to the citadel and its legion of undead, - this is what allowed them to transform into incorporeal lost souls - [Fire Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fire_Soul#Fire_Soul). The fact that those souls contain element of fire may point to a type of containment they were in - here sealed by the Vog's or Vanaduke's fiery curse.

In case of Heart of Ice, [Frozen Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fire_Soul#Frozen_Soul) are as such due to being released from Everfrost, connecting them to the Blinding Abyss and cold in general, referring to our [analysis of Blinding Abyss](#perma-frostifurs-and-blinding-abyss).

Non-elemental Lost Souls of the graveyards are as such due to more mutual process of resurrection - as they are _not bound by curse and are manifested through properties of Cradle which make spirits return to the material realm_. But in case of the Ghost in The Machine - [Static Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Soul#Static_Soul) are already released, despite them still inhabiting the circuits of the Skydome containing the vessel in the form of Dry Docks.

There, the same manner of haunting is present, and why souls would still exist in their unbound state, remains unknown, unless Underworld's presence of greater in that location, such as the case of graveyards.

As for the [Void Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fire_Soul#Void_Soul) - we do have an explanation for them, which will be discussed in relation to the nature of Whitespace and Void later.

Finally, Freed Souls were bound by the traps of Apocrea, which manifest in the properties of Grasping Plateau and metaphysics of harvester capable of manipulating, harvesting those souls, as well as draining them from one carrying them.

It is also there it is seen that Apocrean Harvester is capable of extracting souls from captured knights through the application of the purple beam of light, similar to ones found across depths' near Apocrean Realm within the shroud.

_This process of extraction also damages the knight,_ - we see this as a direct link between the concepts of [Auras and Souls](#auras-and-souls) and currently established metaphysics of Energy and Souls.

Although Auras in that regard remain mostly unknown, the nature of this connection between all of the above concepts seems here evident, potentially even, as different manifestations of the same base concept of Energy.

This can potentially tie in with the concept of [auras](#auras-and-souls), as they should represent an essential part of being. So damaging them, if we take an idea of a soul as a subtle body, would translate to directly damaging the body. Presence of multiple souls can be explained either by knight to be assumed to collect those souls, or by a link with the divine, - as if presence of the souls would link living being to a higher realm, access to which is seemingly desired by Apocrea.

#### Arkus

Could it be, that only death causes loss of consciousness given nature of zombies and Lost Souls? But in case of Arkus, Lord Vanaduke, and potentially Maulos, _they preserve it_, despite going mad or delirious.

This connects to each individuals' powers, as Arkus, despite being partially a trojan and a fiend, has orbiting dark orbs, similar to Vanaduke - in both cases demonstrating magic rarely seen in the wild.

Those dark orbs are also seen in Warmaster Seerus' anti-gremlin bomb, [Dark Retribution](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Retribution), and [neutralizer's](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Neutralizer) projectiles. Apart from that, as here we won't analyze gremlin technology, what else connects the two? Both Vanaduke and Arkus were grieving, which may also play part in their transformation, as discussed earlier.

At the same time, as this topic is directly linked to deific presence, [Vog explicitly transforms selected creatures](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/9995#comment-55776): `The great fire beast Vog isn't a wolver himself, but a fiery deity of sorts who embraces some creatures and grants them a bit of power. Vog's 'cubs' are more or less acquired and forced to spread his fiery love across the world`.

Lastly, Arkus's sword slam attack has pink lightning strike from above, and forms dark crimsotine shards. Those depleted crimsonite shards are the same as tortodrones'. The pink lightning strike may be similar to the one present during summoning of Margrel. [We will explain this phenomenon](#the-resonance), once we have enough information on it. But, due to aforementioned relation to Margrel and yet not analyzed nature of [Dread Seals](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Seal), we will return also to this question [later](#chapter-viii-kat-tribe).

Arkus's transformation may potentially tie in with the location of dust zombie ambush and influence of Underworld. By the concept of Cryptic Statuary, apart from housing stone trojans, belonging implicitly to heavenly kingdom and explicitly by the elevator icon, in that regard, we can speculate that the location of ambush is related to trojans and their transformation - relating to that period in time, when or where trojans were created.

This time period then should be before Almire's Fall, as Legion of Ur had to exist in the Underworld and conquer it.

This may lead to 2 candidates, as we see it: Clockwork Tunnels, as the Statuary is in the tunnels, and Graveyards, - as both have dust zombies, but the latter has only dust zombies without any status effects, apart from curse. Moreover, Graveyards belong to the kingdom of Almire, which makes those zombies people of Almire. As Almire itself is in a permanent state of being cursed, as its lands are cursed, and as [Shadow Firestorm Citadel](#true-citadel-of-almirian-empire) is single location of largest concentration of curse, [apart from one other instance](#miasma), the concept of it dooming anyone traversing its territory would seem fitting.

This would also mean a commitment to an idea of curse being the reason, and dark matter manifestation being the symptom, which we will discuss next.

#### Dark Matter as Manifestation of Curse

As Lord Vanaduke was granted immense power and cursed immortality as he asked to destroy enemy kingdoms, we suggest the same can be told of trojans, spiral wardens of medieval age, as seen by tier 1 design. But is the action, which has cursed those Wardens, did they knew the consequences of this deal with a deity? We lean here to the narrative of a deal with the devil, a deal attached with strings, the strings here being the method through which the desired goal is achieved. _If we commit to this idea if devil's deal, now given that Legion of Ur had conquered the Underworld, what was their wish_?

To compare with Lord Vanaduke, trojans, in this framework seem to be the result of a large scale process of curse, transforming into horse-like beasts, with their armor turning to stone, while retaining some features, seen even in the modern Spiral Order. But the difference lies in the process itself - while Lord Vanaduke's transformation seems to be gifted to him by Vog, that is unknown of Trojans, as well as of Arkus.

As discussed in previous section - it is unknown, what are the conditions which allow for the curse to take affect, transforming its bearer. We have a pattern of grieving, which may or may not serve as a catalyst.

But, exactly here lies the basis of our proposal. Lord Vanaduke, and Darkfire Lord Vanaduke have respective similarity to Slag Zombies and Carnavons by the fact of transformed claws - those are the result of the transformation. And for trojans, their position and role as defenders _twists them in the same thematic manner_ - as they become wardens, but as a fiendish army, invincible from the front, and vulnerable from the back. The vulnerability stems from the crystal. And for Vanaduke, it is his mask, a symbol for somethings. As a king, he carries his scepter, which was linked to the concept of Justice, while twisted by curse and burned by shadow flames: `Only Justice remains, but she too has been twisted by the cursed flames that ravage our kingdom. Justice is now the burning scepter of our once great Lord Vanaduke` ([Legion of Almire - Inner Sanctum - Almirian codex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire/Inner_Sanctum)).

If we attempt to apply logic behind Almirians' transformation, then crystal of dark matter becomes the manifestation of the curse. In case of Lord Vanaduke that manifestation of the curse was his claws and the mask, and potentially the general stature. The mask seem to have a mind of its own, as it operates throughout the fight by itself. It has a small red gem in the forehead, but this is a different topic. This mask's eye pattern can be seen all across the Citadel, oven columns of the buildings.

#### Spiral Wardens and Trojans Similarity: Part 2

One another concept we found interesting, is the thematic element of petrification in the context of eldritch mythos, specifically, their predecessor, "The King in Yellow", mentioned in relation to Apocrea. In "The King in Yellow", the short story of "The Mask" had the element of petrification, wherein any object submerged into a mixture would turn too marble with a pink inner glow, and after a while returning back to its natural state:

<BookCitation source="Robert Chambers - The King in Yellow, The Mask">
  {#snippet markup()}

  He held the lily toward me, and I took it in my hand. It had turned to stone, to the purest marble. The marble was white as snow, but in its depths the veins of the lily were tinged with palest azure, and a faint flush lingered deep in its heart. ... But if you held it to the light the stone was beautifully veined with a faint blue, and from somewhere within came a rosy light like the tint which slumbers in an opal.

  {/snippet}
</BookCitation>

This reminds us of the Cryptic Statuary, and potential reasons for its establishment. Herein we also should point out dark matter crystal burning, similar to the rays of light present in alchemized, as stated by Alec, marble:

<BookCitation source="Robert Chambers - The King in Yellow, The Mask">
  {#snippet markup()}

  "There is one thing I'm curious about," I said, "and that is where the ray of sunlight came from." ... "It looked like a sunbeam true enough," he said. "I don't know, it always comes when I immerse any living thing. Perhaps," he continued, smiling, "perhaps it is the vital spark of the creature escaping to the source from whence it came." ... I laughed too, and told him I was devoured by the desire for gold, and we had better talk of something else; so when Genevieve came in shortly after, we had turned our backs on alchemy.

  {/snippet}
</BookCitation>

The reason we brought up this story here is the earlier idea of poisoned minds and cold heart as the depths' names of Silent Legion mission.

This confusion of being turned to stone _as death or a form of immortality_ may be _related to the idea of poisoned minds_, _tied with the idea of Underworld Deities fulfilling the deal_, but in a _twisted manner, potentially as part of a larger plot_, where wardens were lied to.

The reasons for this scenario may potentially lie in the suggestion of immortal or eternal servitude - as under current logic, _we know that Spiral Wardens do abide to Guardian's Oath, and them betraying it would be equal to death_ - a symbolic death referred to Arkus, and literal death for Vanaduke.

Since we are referring here to Guardian's Oath, and we do not know its contents, we will mention relations to it:

- `Grantz was the real veteran of the bunch. A seasoned Guardian, Grantz specialized in keeping his squad safe, namely by crushing anything that would mean to do them harm. Grantz took his Guardian's Oath very seriously, often putting himself directly in harm's way in order to protect another. The guy was selfless. I imagine that if disaster truly befell the Alpha Squad, Grantz didn't let it end without one hell of a fight` ([The Pioneers - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Pioneers)).
- `Guardian Knight Arkus was one of the finest warriors serving the Spiral Knights until some time shortly after the crash. As one of the first to search for the Alpha Squad, Arkus's own squad perished in a grisly battle with a horde of dust zombies. Since then, Arkus has blamed himself for their loss, saying that he betrayed his Guardian's Oath to protect his squad. Arkus now journeys into the Clockworks alone, never risking the loss of another squad and we believe, somehow trying to find the squad he once lost. As these expeditions began to appear self-deconstructive, Spiral HQ issued him a direct order to cease. Arkus ignored these orders and has gone deep into the Clockworks and has not returned. Not wanting to lose the last of his squad, Spiral HQ is asking you to pursue him to his last known whereabouts, some kind of mysterious sanctuary at depth 26` ([The Silent Legion](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Silent_Legion)).
- `Heavy weapons require precise timing to use effectively and the gear tends to slow you down some. But what you sacrifice in usability is returned in sheer power. The gear I specialize in will make you a knight that your squad can depend upon to stay alive and face even the fiercest of monsters` ([Izola](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Izola)).
- `Strong, yet light armor for knights who've sworn an oath to hunt down and destroy the undead, wherever it may lurk` ([Silvermail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silvermail)).

    It may be connected to [Cold Iron Vanquisher](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Vanquisher): `A powerful cold iron blade forged for the singular purpose of hunting down and destroying the undead`, and it is connected, similar to the [Leviathan Blade](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Leviathan_Blade). It is very likely that those who did wear this armor were in a similar position to Wardens, but, the armor itself strongly related to valkyries and their actions onto Underworld. So, we have a large gap, which might lead to the history of the Legion of Ur, __given that both have an extremely fantasy-themed equipment__.

Would then Wardens be at the precipice of potentially becoming immortal or invulnerable though those means, and being lied to, becoming the enemies of once they promised to protect? Then whom, under those extreme conditions, they would sworn to protect, while allowing them to the transformed becoming fiends? _If trojans' minds are poisoned, considering their alliance with devilites as a Legion of Ur, does it mean that it is the rest of the material realm who they are made to hold disdain of_?

Could this narrative tie with the Sleeper, even: `THIS WORLD WAS CREATED TO PROTECT ME. VULNERABLE IN SLUMBER, WORLDS WERE DRAWN TO SHIELD ME FROM THE DARKNESS.` ([Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory)), in the same manner, as Valkyries were also possessing a role as guardians? This would align with the concept of Undercorp and rest of soul-harvesting civilizations to compromise the defenses of the realm from which this energy in form of souls comes from. In this iteration, our proposed narrative of Wardens being those guardians and then being twisted by Underworld seems be fitting.

For this, we will need to look into a different period of time, preceding Almire and a war of those 3 kingdoms, leading up to theorized ancient arrival of Isorans to this planet before Cradle.

#### Nature of Darkfire

While we will not touch upon [the canon of Shadow Lairs](#shadow-lairs), what important now is to analyze nature of Darkfire, as it is associated to the most cursed location currently, be it regular Firestorm Citadel or Shadow Firestorm Citadel. We will attempt to find connections to the metaphysics of souls and minerals, and specifically _nature of curses in material realm_.

It is stated that Darkfire Lord Vanaduke became such, - a distinct entity from Lord Vanaduke, due to an unknown powerful curse falling onto the firestorm citadel: `A powerful curse has overtaken the Firestorm Citadel, transforming its hordes and lead by the mighty Darkfire Lord Vanaduke!` ([Release Notes: 2011.10.19](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2011-10-19)). This curse is manifested most prominently in the different transformation of Lord Vanaduke, pink glow of volcanic chamber, and presence of Carnavons, and all are affected by the curse. Does this mean, that Darkfire Lord Vanaduke or darkfire in general is created through Vog's curse, followed by a different, more widespread and present curse, associated with the curse status effect?

Carnavons in that matter serve as a link of this curse being the same as one taking effects on Isorans in the form of the curse status effect, _even possessing a crudely drawn sigil of the same color on their blackened crests_.

Black Kats, mentioned in relation to Auras in the [Auras and Souls section](#auras-and-souls), also have this capacity to inflict curse, and all having the [Dread Seal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Seal) with an image of evil eye, which links to the Underworld.

This curse also exists outside of Shadow Lairs as Carnavons are summoned by Black Kats across Clockworks, and the latter are being summoned by an unknown party.

Carnavons' blackened crests have same purple cracks instead of fiery ones, similar to trojans, but the latter are incapable of inflicting curse, and only Carnavons have inscribed curse symbol of their Almirian Crests.

Lord Vanaduke became an immortal giant after his initial transformation by Vog and due to this Firestorm Citadel has been burning for at least thousand of years. We know that Lord Vanaduke has power over flame souls and his mask, to which we will return soon, as it has another flame soul, behaving seemingly as a standalone entity, and stated to be Vanaduke's source of power: `Our sensors show the mask is a source of power as well as a potential weakness` ([Monstrous Codex: Lord Vanaduke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel/Throne_Room)). There is also armor, which seems to be transformed with the wielder itself, having large chains holding it together, similar to a cage in both instances of Lord Vanaduke. We point out those element as we will return to them one more time in the context of a [dedicated analysis of Shadow Firestorm Citadel](#true-citadel-of-almirian-empire).

Finally, [Dark Ember](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember) _can be acquired without descending into the Shadow Lairs_. [Dark Ember's](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember) description states: `A mote of burning energy salvaged from Lord Vanaduke's throne room. It slowly smolders with a sinister intensity, creating an almost hypnotic trance when gazed upon for any length of time`. This description is vague, as it does not attribute to any version of the Citadel, but, as the inventory icon depicts it as purple mote, _we attribute it to the source of darkfire_. Yet, there are no known laws, apart from themes, which would forbid dark embers to be present in the regular Citadel, as the color of Firestorm Citadel is of regular, red fire, albeit referred by Nature Sprites as Shadow Fire.

Another instance of purple flame is seen across Moorcroft Manor in floating fire bowls. Weather it is the same dark ember is unknown, but it would plausible, since those same embers are found across Shadow Firestorm Citadel. As far as specificity of those elements goes, it can be an asset reuse, similar to [Skylark's secondary generator](#skylark).

Due to those factors, as well as unknown canonicity of Shadow Firestorm Citadel, we need to work through each instance of purple color carefully and through multiple iteration as we gather more information on the metaphysics.

These factors make us think of Vog's curse being still unfamiliar to Spiral Order, only seen experienced directly through the properties of [Fang of Vog](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fang_of_Vog), while curse status effect represents a greater Curse, a more widespread and afflicting Spiral Knights as a game mechanic. Both have a distinct, cracked or shattered design on the afflicted entities, be it equipment or creatures.

In this distinction, we may suggest for now, that _there are 2 curses - one of fire of Vog, and the other of the same nature as seen outside of the Citadel_. Both of those curses originate from the Underworld and are capable of trapping or binding souls and inflict undeath onto creatures of material realm, a form of cursed immortality, as in earlier instances of this phenomenon.

This can be further affirmed by the description of Citadel being cursed, __as if the curse was applied externally__, rather than an emergent property of the prior. This fits with the design of Carnavons, as _they have a crudely drawn curse symbol drawn on their Blackened Crest_ - __someone had to draw it__. But, it is unknown weather this mark and the dread seal is the source of curse, or even their general role. We are yet to cover them in the context of Black Kats and Kat Tribe.

Then, by the fact of Citadel being cursed, we can suggest, that Slag Walkers became Carnavons through this curse, and, as both wear armor, we have previously attributed both to the Almirian army.

Not all members of legion of Almire are burning in darkfire, leaving crusaders and royal guards as ones transformed through Lord Vanaduke's initial arrival from the mountains, as they retain their color scheme.

Those factor seems to us as an initial bridge between those types of curse and dark matter. Darkfire could be considered in that context a unique phenomenon emerging from Underworld fires. Then, is Shadow Fire the same phenomenon as Darkfire?

While Shadow Fire had its own design, acknowledged by Nature Sprites, darkfire is explicitly purple and remains as such through the information gathered from the designs of Shadow Firestorm Citadel and Dark Embers. As far as we can be aware, there are multiple sources of purple fire, including a burning dark embers, which are a significant source of confusion for us.

This leaves us with 2 initial proposals:

- Darkfire is the same pink fire that accompanies trojans of tier 2 and 3, as well as Arkus, Carnavons, and fire bowls of Moorcroft Manor, as well as of Shadow Firestorm Citadel.

    This proposal is based on prior design similarities across all of those subjects, albeit with slight color variations.
- Darkfire is the result of 2 curses merging - giving to Vog's fires this curse-bearing or curse-inflicting property, different from a transformative fiery curse, as one seen across Legion of Almire.

    And, as this purple curse seems to be far more widespread and as only it has the connection to the evil eye, and adopted it as its symbol among Spiral Order, as well as presence of Underworld's cultural imprint - in case of Tortomega.

    Another argument fot this explanation is based on the design of a unique fire soul behind Darkfire Lord Vanaduke's mask - no such color is present across Cradle so far - of red-pink curse aura and purple core, combining both fiery aspect of Lord Vanaduke, but also being color-coded as curse-bearing element.

    This orb of fire, as far as curse color-coded fire allows, could be a distinct presence of curse, separate from dark embers, which are explicitly purple, but thematically fitting to reddish color of curse [found prior in the collapsed grim gates](#grim-gates-portal-collapse).

It is also important to note, that Dark Ember, being the boss trophy, was added [after](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2012-12-12) [introduction](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2011-10-19) of Shadow Lairs, with nearly a year of a gap. So far we will only hold onto this information until [reaching analysis of Shadow Lairs](#shadow-lairs).

Considering many instances of unreliable narrations so far, even with cases such as Nameless Realm, while is named once, darkfire, due to Vanaduke's mask argument and existence of Darkfire Lord Vanaduke, darkfire seems to us as a distinct phenomenon, attributed to dark embers. And, as latter are specified as `A mote of burning energy salvaged from Lord Vanaduke's throne room. It slowly smolders with a sinister intensity, creating an almost hypnotic trance when gazed upon for any length of time` ([Dark Ember](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember)), we have to look into the canon of the events involving traversal of [Shadow Firestorm Citadel](#true-citadel-of-almirian-empire).

As of now, we propose that both of those curses have underlying common nature, emerging from the Underworld, as well as its deities:

- Vog's curse gives the curse-bearer power to exist beyond regular laws of their species, the case of Isorans it is Lord Vanaduke.

    Lord Vanaduke had transcended ages while being bound to his armor, and capable of upholding entire Citadel in stasis, with his mask being important to his state.
- Maulos is transformed by everfrost, seem to have retained mind of his own, compared to rest of trojans.

    He is capable of frost magic affecting an entire fiendish city of Amu-Sol. And as trojans were already covered, we believe that the curse in question can manifest differently depending on its application, resulting in different effects and magnitude, but inevitably tracing back to the Underworld and greater understanding of nature of shadow damage.

##### Spiral Wardens and Trojans Similarity: Part 3

When dark matter crystal is shattered, trojan petrifies, he can potentially be reanimated from stone, but it was not ever seen. As a matter of fact, trojan petrifies. If we take into account similarity of Arkus and other trojans, we lean to a conclusion of trojans being transformed by the curse, which manifested as dark matter, and housed their souls. More connection toSpiral Wardens emerge here, as the [warden's or colossal prize box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Colossal_Prize_Box) contains a prismatic back crystal, called with a odd name - [Ruinous Crystal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Prismatic_Ruinous_Crystal), __one that brings ruin__. _Its presence within Spiral Order-themed prize box seems extremely ominous_.

We have to point out that wardens are called here as colossi, reminding of the [Call of the Colossi](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Call_of_the_Colossi). There, the colossi were seemingly tortodrones, or tortomega, [who were calling for tortodrones on a Long Migration](#veiled-tortodrone-homeland), as we have previously explored there [fall to Undercorp](#the-titans-tortomega-the-fall). [Warden Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Warden_Helm) is also described as `The helm of the Stalwart Spiral Wardens is said to give great comfort to other knights. Nothing says "here comes the cavalry" like the sight of these iron giants taking to the battlefield`, associating wardens to giants.

The further element, linking trojans and wardens is found in the [announcement itself](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/95960): `Spiral Wardens are well known for being guardians and protectors, sworn to put the safety of others before their own. Are you up to the challenge of becoming one of these brave champions? If you are, you need to look the part! Through February 3rd, 2014, get distinctive Spiral Warden horse head costume items in Colossal Prize Boxes! (Or if you want a touch of corruption in your life and you'd rather look like a Trojan, you can do that too.*) Contents of the Colossal Prize Box may include: Warden Armors and Helms; Trojan Tail accessory; Baleful Aura; Prismatic Ruinous Crystal accessory; Fireworks in every box! Read all the details right here.` ([Onward to the Year of the Horse!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/95960)).

This directly characterized trojans as corrupted, which follows our suggestion of them being falling under corruptive, or ruinous influence. Yet, the name `ruinous` is vague as it does explicitly the reason for the corruption, but makes strong implication to be the catalyst for it.

We would lean to this idea of the crystal being the catalyst, rather than a symptom, but given presence of other dark matter instances - of Carnavons' and Lord Vanaduke's claws, it seems less likely even with the entire plot of corrupted tortodrones.

We made previously a suggestion of the sigils either summoning the crystal or securing it, but, as tortodrones are constructs, it should be also considered.

Lastly, there is Arkus, who is also in possession of dark matter crystal. As our idea of him physically perishing sometime during his traversal of Clockworks seems to thin, he would have no case of an intervention, through which a crystal could've been embedded.

Trojan's [Baleful Aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Baleful_Aura#Baleful_Aura) is one which is most seen on tier 2 trojans, suggesting it being as important to the laws of this affliction, as the ruinous crystal.

Lastly, there the [Warden Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Warden_Armor) in its design, chestpiece specifically, is identical to the redwood chestpiece design of tier 1 trojans.

Considering so far all of those aspects, we believe, that a long time ago, __Spiral Wardens were transformed into trojans of the Legion of Ur__ before even Skylark and Iron Hulk crash landed on Cradle. This time would precede Almire, as Lord Vanaduke had to return with this legion, but not after the it would be sealed in the Underworld by Valkyries. The transformation, which had to happen then, could potentially be similar to one Arkus has to go through, as he already identified as a fiend.

As mentioned earlier, we will make the second iteration of this concept, as we approach Shadow Lairs.

##### Vanaduke's Mask and <span class="through-curse">Immortality Through Curse</span>

The exact nature of Blackened Shrine is unknown, although, as it is very likely a fiendish device.

We suspect it being similar to grim totems, which are the only fiendish objects, capable of resurrecting zombies from their own skulls. Could it be that the skull is the remaining and essential part from which resurrection can be performed? __We saw Lost Souls being housed within the skulls__ [all across Cradle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_(Skull)).

And if so, could similar principal be applied to Lord Vanaduke's mask, as it is stated: `Our sensors show the mask is a source of power as well as a potential weakness` ([Monstrous Codex: Lord Vanaduke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vanaduke#About))?

Lord Vanaduke's mask seemingly lives on its own, while Lord Vanaduke is invincible. Notably, the mask on its inner side has a flame soul or curse-colored soul, maybe even darkfire soul. In the first case it is the same as ones observed to be orbiting Lord Vanaduke after initial damage to the mask. The second case is, as [described earlier](#nature-of-darkfire), makes it unique, due to which we suspect it being depiction of darkfire with a characteristic color, attributed to curse.

When mask is damaged enough, it returns to its owner in as a fiery soul, exploding on contact, which seems to be staggering Vanaduke. We believe that this is Vanaduke's soul most present. This can be reaffirmed by the fact that only his orbiting fiery orbs have eyes, but [are referred as flame souls on the wiki](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lord_Vanaduke), likely similar entities found as a material - [Flame Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul): `A powerful essence that left behind when a creature perishes during a blind, fiery rage`. The same proposal we made, when we had analyzed the meaning behind Lost Souls of Almire quote: `His soul bound to some horrific armored prison` ([Alone in the Dark - Lost Soul of Almire](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire_(nameless)#Dialogue>)). But, given the fact that Lord Vanaduke is the source of the damnation, and his armor's cage-like design, we suspect the second interpretation of his armor being his prison to be more likely. More so, when Lord Vanaduke is defeated, we see a small flame erupt from his face, seemingly being that exact soul.

Compared to trojans, on defeat, Vanaduke's body completely burns up, with only his scepter remaining. But, as evident by later alchemized [Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lord_Vanaduke%27s_Mask) and [Finery](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lord_Vanaduke%27s_Finery), something had remained of him:

- `The sinister mask formerly worn by Vanaduke, Lord of the Firestorm Citadel. its far too big for a knight to wear` ([Vanaduke's Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lord_Vanaduke%27s_Mask)). It is alchemized with the usage of [Soul Dust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul_Dust): `The dust of the departed. Whether it still retains any shred of a soul remains to be seen`.
- `An artistic arrangement of Lord Vanaduke's mask, armor and scepter. It represents the folly of greed, the agony of despair, and how awesome fire and spikes look together` ([Finery](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lord_Vanaduke%27s_Finery)).

Mask's description suggests that it was taken of the Lord after the events of the King of Ashes: `The sinister mask formerly worn by Vanaduke, Lord of the Firestorm Citadel. its far too big for a knight to wear` ([Lord Vanaduke's Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lord_Vanaduke's_Mask)). Based on this, we lean to an explanation, that in canon timeline, __Lord Vanaduke's mask was salvaged__. We also suggest, as his scepter remains after death, the finery was also taken from the Citadel, despite it burning up in the mission. As for the resourced required to alchemize the mask, they do expand on the state of the mask itself. More so, compared to most of the roster of [Armero Alchemy Machine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Armero_Alchemy_Machine), Almire's furniture is not said to be replicated:

- `A magnificently preserved royal seal of the lost kingdom of Almire. It probably belongs in a museum` ([Almirian Seal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_Seal_(Furniture))).
- `A jolly piece of jewelry formerly borne by the Royal Jelly himself. It is jauntily perched on a gelatinous pillow` ([Royal Jelly Crown](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Crown_(Furniture))).

    That is while [Royal Jelly Crown](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Crown) as the equipment is stated to be reproduced: `Ruggedly royal regalia recently reproduced from regally resinous remains`. Seemingly the same can be said of [Ice Queen Crown](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ice_Queen_Crown): `A regal crown resembling that ever-frigid Ice Queen. In addition to providing great defense, it is said to dramatically boost one's ego and create a cold detachment from those around them`.

- `A squishy gem highly prized by slimes. This one was liberated from the Royal Jelly Palace and painstakingly preserved as a conversation piece` ([Jelly Gem](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jelly_Gem_(Furniture))).

The fact that both kingdoms' trophies are considered unique to a degree, we can draw parallels to them [containing gremlin consoles](#gremlin-containments-and-consoles), which is a pattern.

The presence of remains of Vanaduke's soul within his mask can be identified by the themes of equipment alchemized with the Soul Dust, specifically the case of [Skelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Skelly_Shield) alchemy line.

This line of shields was touched upon when we [analyzed truthfulness of Arkus's haunting](#haunting), concluding on it being valid.

Here we delve into alchemical materials for those items, as their presence both for the Mask and the Finery is very specific.

The [Sinister Skelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sinister_Skelly_Shield) is the first one to specify presence of ghost - `A kite shield haunted by a benevolent ghost`, - at the same time as [Blighted Bone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blighted_Bone) is presented into its alchemy.

The [Scary Skelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scary_Skelly_Shield), a 3-star item, is the first to use Soul Dust, but has no mention of haunting: `A small, spooky shield to safeguard you from shadow` ([Scary Skelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scary_Skelly_Shield)).

This tells one thing to us: Soul Dust is not the source of haunting, but blighted bone is the material which ultimately results in __spirit binding to an object__, likely with the assistance of the Soul Dust and Grave Soil. We can suggest that is is soul's corporeal body, its remains, that of bones, or an object which allow for it to exist in such state.

This concept can be applied to the distinction between Lord Vanaduke's Mask and Finery, with the latter being seemingly haunted by his presence though burning eys of the mask.

Finery is the one utilizing [Blighted Bone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blighted_Bone) in its alchemy. This may not explicitly mean, that the departed Vanaduke's souls is rebound, but some ot its image remains, as specified by the [Soul Dust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul_Dust): `The dust of the departed. Whether it still retains any shred of a soul remains to be seen`.

As for the design of the mask, one element we mentioned several times was the _red gem embedded into the mask_. Across cultures such symbolism is usually referred to the _Third Eye or a connection to otherworldly forces_. In case of Lord Vanaduke, we would argue that the mask is manifestation of the curse and is the face of the deity by the reasoning that Almirian Armor remains similar to Spiral Order in its medieval designs, and presence of unconventional elements is rare.

The only close case of similar themes are the [Grim Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Oni_Helm) and [Diablo Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Diablo_Helm), both of them preserve general Spiral Order designs. This may be potentially affirmed by the design of the _spike-like jaw_, as in cases of [Authentic Phantom Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Authentic_Phantom_Mask) [Grim Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Mask) and [Fiend Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiend_Mask) all of them referencing a skull with a greater accent of the undeath and Underworld, __as if this symbolism is characteristic of Underworld as the [evil or curse eye](#evil-eye)__.

While this may serve as a closure for Almire, Legion of Ur, which we suggested to be the fiendish army led by Lord Vanaduke, remains unsolved despite potential reasons for their transformation being vaguely defined. We had proposed them being formed before kingdom of Almire, as former Isoran Wardens. They would outlast Almire and it is how they became sealed we must discuss next.

### Intermission: Gunslinger Priests of Forgotten Time

After assisting Lord Vanaduke, a fiendish army, which we believe to be so far the Legion of Ur, returned into the Underworld.

Heavenly kingdom up to that moment was not affected by Lord Vanaduke's crusade. But, we have a few items, suggesting a past conflict between Valkyries and Underworld, which was the reason for unnatural turn of event for Almire:

- `Its golden frame was believed to provide light within the impenetrable darkness of the Underworld` ([Gilded Griffin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin)).

    Here we are presented with gunslingers, who have descended into the Underworld and witnessed it. So far on the timeline the only people to witness Underworld, remotely even, were _torjans_ and _magmatic cultists_, the trojans being a more ancient case, related to Isorans and a narrative of those landing onto Cradle before existence of Almire.

    Then we have an _advanced enough technology and magic_ to allow creation of a such handguns, as well as knowledge knew of _draconic designs_. Although here referred as, or placed alongside griffins, based on the name and draconic designs on handgun's barrel, it is an item of unknwon origin so far.

    The griffin in question may be referring to the apparition of a griffin during handgun's charge. This ties with a still vague nature of those handgun creators' species and their role in that period of time.
- `A holy sword created in another time to arm knights who fought against the legions of the Underworld` ([Avenger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Avenger)) and the [Divine Avenger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_avenger): `An upgraded Avenger formed from the purest sun steel. There are few foes remaining in this world that are worthy enough to be defeated by such a fine blade, and there are still fewer heroes worthy of wielding it`.

    Those have similar designs to the [Heavenly Guardian Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Guardian_Armor), which does look like one belonging to knights of modern Spiral Order, if judged by, for example, [Heavenly Guardian Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Guardian_Helm).

Of course, handgun and sword may belong to a different eras, as they don't seem to thematically connect at any point, apart from an implication that both were wielded by owners who had seen and been to the Underworld.

#### Owlites and Valkyries of Heavenly Kingdom

It is important to address the lingering inconsistency of the species of the heavenly kingdom, - what are valkyries?

Valkyries were the heavenly kingdom's army and people, as suggested by [Angelic Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angelic_Helm): `A beautiful helm made to resemble a heavenly guardian`. The kingdom was supposedly located on the grounds of what later became the Scarlet Fortress in present time. This kingdom was already capable of flight prior to Clockworks, as suggested by the [Avenger Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Avenger_Helm): `A helm worm by heavenly guardians who watch over a kingdom hidden atop a magma-covered mountain`. This makes it implicit as well as _thematically fitting for the inhabitants of this flying kingdom being an avian species_, and __so far we were leaning to an idea of valkyries being a name for Owlites who were part of the army, the "heavenly guardians"__, as to those requirements both valkyries and Owlites could fit.

But, as valkyries are tied through their name to norse mythology, them being Owlites seems while fascinating as a concept, it does not fit with current themes of Owlites being a separate species, _whose strategies are less close combat-focused_.

Far earlier, we have suggested, that this could be a multi-species civilization, or that we have encountered a case of a distinct separation of duties within valkyrian army, with the academy being an entity focused on research of magics and their later application in combat.

On the other hand, valkyries seem to be too distinct in their designs, even if we consider a case of the being Owlites, - the same motif of wings seems far too redundant then, - which was one of primary reasons for our suspicions on them being separate species.

In the next section we will analyze this distinction, pointing out similarities and differences, as well as look closer at the overarching themes.

#### Identity of Valkyries

While valkyries were covered as ones inspired by norse mythology, they - as species, - have remained unknown.

As for Owlites, [Owlite Robe](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_Robe) heavily implies their upper limbs used to be wings or seem as such, while capable of holding and grabbing.

On the contrary, Valkyries could have had wings on their backs, as suggested by the design of [Valkyrie Wings](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Wings) and [a raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raiment_(Costume)): `A long, flowing battle garb best accessorized with a pair of angelic wings`.

This approach is reminiscent of Spiral Order [adding wings to preexisting designs]().

As Owlites in the [respective news art](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:SpiralKnights_News_254-big.png) carry an [astrolabe](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Astrolabe), - due to its presence we can suggest a more direct inclusion of magic, as symbols carved on the outer ring of astrolabe are similar to ones present of the [Enchanted Aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Enchanter_Aura#Enchanter_Aura) and Owlite robe, specifically, _a star and a crescent moon_. The prior symbols are similar to [fiendish sigils](#fiendish-glyphs), but possess a more arcane shape. What is important in this context, is that _Valkyries lack any of those arcane themes_. This makes our suggestion of Owlites being research-focused branch for heavenly kingdom less plausible, since this would result in Valkyries carrying those advancements in their armors and weapons. _That is if Owlites are as old as Valkyries_. We will keep this in mind, as it will be important later.

The [Heavenly Iron set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Armor) links heavenly kingdom, valkyries and Owlites: `A powerful suit of armor said to be crafted from angelic shields. It retains many divine properties celestial beings possess but lacks their weakness to fire` ([Heavenly Iron set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Armor)). We could've proposed, that dragon scales are the angelic shields, specifically of the divine dragon, but we lack evidence for this.

Owlites and Valkyries were both weak to fire and specialized in protecting themselves from it, as well as from electric shock, likely due to location of the kingdom in the clouds, as suggested by the [storm chaser](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Chaser): `A rare elemental found hovering in storm clouds. Their electric hum creates an almost melodic choir that can be faintly heard between thunderclaps`. The information on the _common weaknesses_ is gathered from the following items:

- 3-star `A beautiful suit of armor that constantly shines as if illuminated by the sun` ([Angelic Raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angelic_Raiment)), up to 5-star `A priceless set of armor whose name denizens of the Underworld dare not mention` ([Valkyrie Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Mail)) are vulnerable to fire, resistant to curse and poison. Poison so far was also associated to shadow damage. Here armors have split normal and shadow damage protection.
- `It retains many divine properties celestial beings possess but lacks their weakness to fire` ([Heavenly Iron Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Armor)). Compared to above upgrade line, it is resistant to fire, but vulnerable to shock. Fire resistance is neutral in that case, but can be considered as an upgrade, _as specified by the armor itself_, affirming it being a higher tier upgrade to the 5-star [Valkyrie Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Mail). As it is acquired through preparation and traversal of Shadow Lairs, it seems fitting.

    At that point we already have a motif of, at least, __valkyries being weak to fire. At that, we consider "celestial beings" to be valkyries__. The description implies, that it is beings themselves that are weak to fire.
- `A cursed suit of armor once worn by a celestial being cast down from paradise` ([Armor of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Armor_of_the_Fallen)) is different in that regard, while it has _same resistance to fire as Heavenly Iron set_, it is by all aspects corrupted by Underworld.

    This characteristic is evident given armor's and helm's design and description (`A cursed crown once worn by a celestial being cast down from paradise` - [Crown of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crown_of_the_Fallen)), and negation of dealt damage to fiends due to damage penalty.

    But, this armor in particular has strong resistance to fire, as if its fiendish nature or the process of aligning to Underworld gave it such property.

    We believe it is but a result of a single entity's doing, a valkyrian, as suggested by the _design borrowed_ from [Valkyrie Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Mail), but with the resistance to fire from a higher-grade armor. In the context of Valkyrian weakness to fire, _this reads as an exchange, reminiscent of other cases of curse's influence_, a theme of a deal with the devil or of a fantasy unholy corruption.
- `A cloak for renowned Owlite scholars, this feathery frock is filled with the wisdom of the ages` ([Grey Feather Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Feather_Mantle)) is _resistant to fire and shock_.
- `A heavenly cloak thought to be once worn by celestial sages` ([Divine Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Mantle)) is _resistant to fire and shock_, as well as curse.

    It is the only cloak in alchemy tree that is resistant to shadow damage instead of elemental.

- `A resplendent replica of the shield thought to have been issued to the most eminent of Owlite wizards. Wielding it fills you with righteous vengeance` ([Grey Owlite Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Owlite_Shield)) is _resistant to both fire and shock_. The owner of this shield will concern us later.

    It is one of 2 shield having same resists, the other being [Crest of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crest_of_Almire). Crest of Almire being an interpretation of Almire by Spiral Order may be a reason for its defenses. It can also be the case of [Miracloth](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Miracloth) providing shock resistances, given its description: `A marvelous bolt of sublimely supple fabric`.

    The `righteous` characteristic of Grey Owlite Shield is similar to [Seraphic Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphic_Mail): `A beautiful mail coat that causes its wearer to strike out at evil with righteous fury`. We know that Owlites were erased by the Kataclysm due to Kat Tribe activity, and this is a solid reason for Owlite to hold feelings for them, a vengeance.

- `An upgraded set of Silvermail that is said to shine brightly even in the darkest of hours` ([Radiant Silvermail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Radiant_Silvermail)). It has [Philoso Feather](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Philoso_Feather) used in its alchemy and is an upgrade of 4-star [Silvermail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silvermail): `Strong, yet light armor for knights who've sworn an oath to hunt down and destroy the undead, wherever it may lurk`.

    A peculiar element to those recipes consists of lack of [Trojan Horseshoe](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Trojan_Horseshoe), compared to other valkyrian armors, implying a connection to the Legion of Ur and the time it was sealed, alluding to those events.

    Mention of `knights` and of `oath` is similar to Guardian's Oath of Spiral Order, but also to [Blackhawk](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blackhawk): `A shadow-aligned handgun of incredible power, it's said to contain the soul of a knight who was only two days from retirement`, - _presenting a concept of handgun-wielding knights_.

This theme of opposing the unholy, undead and fiends is similar to Gilded Griffin's description, potentially referring to the same period of time: `A beautiful pistol named after a great, noble beast. Its golden frame was believed to provide light within the impenetrable darkness of the Underworld` ([Gilded Griffin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin)). This present a plausible case of those __knight being the Gunslinger Priests__, referred in [Silversix](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silversix): `A mysterious antique with a brilliant silver finish, these handguns are said to have been wielded by 'gunslinger priests' during a now forgotten time`.

This idea connects most of [Antigua's alchemy tree](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Antigua#Alchemy_Path) to this group of knights and a period of time referred as the `forgotten time`: `A mysterious relic from a forgotten time` ([Antigua](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Antigua)).

Now for the properties of [Silvermail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silvermail) and its 5-star variant, _they have to weakness to fire_, but resistances to both poison and curse.

And, given their design, we suspect them being created in a different time for the purpose of specifically fighting the Undead, and then greater Underworld, due to to [Radiant Silvermail's](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Radiant_Silvermail) - `... said to shine brightly even in the darkest of hours`, thematic similarity to [Gilded Griffin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin) - `... golden frame was believed to provide light within the impenetrable darkness of the Underworld`. And, as this line of armors has Owlite-themed material, we have linked it to the prior concept of Valkyries being closely related to Owlites.

So far we have a proposal, that [Silversix](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silversix) belongs to the set of [Silvermail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silvermail), as both are _referring to knights which combat Undead as supposed Gunslinger Priests, despite their corrsponding out-of-universe inspiration_. Presence of [Philoso Feather](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Philoso_Feather) for both handgun and armor's 5-star variants, as well as the design transition to pale yellow radiance associated with Sun Silver, seems intentional.

As [Radiant Silvermail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Radiant_Silvermail) is the final upgrade of [Drake Scale Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Mail) alchemy path, the piecing defense is likely derived from this beast scales - [drake scales](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale), which are notable absent in Silvermail and its upgrade.

That seems to be the same motif of dragons or Valkyries opposing the Underworld. Those similarities also seem to be highlighting Owlites' and Valkyrian relation in perception of shadow damage. Shadow damage then is seen as one be protected from through application of the divine, in the form of equipment.

Due to those similartities, we are leaning to an idea of both at least inhabiting heavenly kingdom, and at best, being one spcecies at across different periods of time through introductions of historical inaccuracies.

##### Definition of Divinity and Celestial Beings

Aforementioned connection of Owlites to Valkyries through common themes, does not explain the reason behind of Valkyries being called the celestial beings, and their nature at that.

It can be understood through the same lens of biblical lore, same as the Armor of The Fallen, by linking Valkyries to Angels in their heavenly kingdom, even using the term of celestial beings, applicable to celestial entities, referenced in cases, such as [Seraphic Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphic_Mail): `A beautiful mail coat that causes its wearer to strike out at evil with righteous fury` - of _celestial seraphim in presence of God_.

Owlites in that context completely lack any of those characteristics, only approaching it through the [Divine Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Mantle), referencing Owlites as the `celestial sages` (`A heavenly cloak thought to be once worn by celestial sages` - [Divine Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Mantle)). In this case the celestial property and divinity are present _to the point of protection from curse_.

In the recipe of [Divine Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Mantle) there is [Silverweave](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silverweave), and, as it is described as `length of understated cloth intricately interwoven with precious metal. It's tastefully ostentatious, yet prudently protective` ([Silverweave](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silverweave)), we suggest that to some degree, [Sun Silver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_silver) is what grants it its divine or celestial properties.

This would make supposed Gunslinger Priests' set to be also made of Sun Silver, attributing to primarily its elemental damage, targeted at the undead.

This connection of __divine and celestial seems as an interchangeable term in opposition to shadow damage and Underworld__, is [reminiscent of the primordial elements represented by dragons](#dragons). There we have connected divinity of divine _drakon_ and hypothesized divine _dragon_ to elemental damage through concept of storms. But in case of both Valkyries and Owlites, divinity for the most part is characterized by piercing damage in offense, shadow damage defense, and in lesser manner elemental damage both in defense and offense.

We have to point out that all 5-star upgrades of [Magic Hood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magic_Hood) contain elemental defense. At that, __elemental damage is most prominently characterized as magic__. Given context of Chaos Cloak, could it be, that elemental damage is at the foundation of the divine through the connection to the [Nameless Realm](#nameless-realm), and _due to which it is characterized both divine and magical_? So far we have not much arguments to affirm it, but, we will return to this concept, once we have more information on Kat Tribe.

Based on the above items we can consider, that _Owlite High Academy of Magicks had its own strategic role in the research field of defenses of valkyries of heavenly kingdom_. Some of the developed armors, while not directly designed to be offensive, were worn by the celestial sages of the Academy (`A heavenly cloak thought to be once worn by celestial sages` - [Divine Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Mantle)), with the focus on elemental damage and magic, reminding of the [Nameless Realm as one related to elemental damage](#nameless-realm).

At that point, there are celestial beings - Valkyries, - which are connected to the concept of divinity through prominence of elemental damage and defense mastery.

During Academy's continuous operation, Owlites had likely discovered an elemental realm, labeling it as the Nameless Realm (`A forbidden mantle said to grant the wearer protection within the nameless realm where all elements are said to converge into one and divide into all` - [Chaos Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_Cloak)) seemingly by the knowledge and Underworld materials acquired by Valkyrian incursion in to the Underworld, as they are used in the recipe of Chaos Cloak, such as [Trojan Horseshoe](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Trojan_Horseshoe).

So far we can place armors of heavenly kingdom to ones which were created without involvement of trojans, mostly revolving around undead, and those which are focused on Underworld and fiends with a large yet subtle accent of the Legion of Ur.

And as all of Owlite equipment of that alchemy tree has elemental defense, __discovery of Nameless Realm seems as a major point in their understanding of the Universe__. At that we still do not know, weather Owlites have derived most of elemental gear from this discovery, or the discovery of a separate realm has followed later? As of currently, Owlite academy was experimenting with many elements, which, compared to the valkyrian army, led to Owlites' academy uniforms being protected from both fire and shock.

Essentially, we have a vague timeline of a Forgotten Time, wherein:

1. There would be Wardens. Wardens are to be transformed into trojans.
2. Prior to this, Valkyries, as celestial beings, branch to 2 possible scenarios. They either started from fighting undead, transitioning to fighting fiends in the Underworld utilizing elemental-damage gear. Or, this period of Gunslinger Priests would follow a more ancient approach around piercing damage. Both scenarios are influenced by the event of Isorans arriving and transforming to trojans, but presence of Underworld in relation to Isoran arrival is debatable.

We make such proposal based on the above concepts of elemental damage-focused gear at 5 stars being described as one used to combat fiends of Underworld. So far we lean to an idea of Gunslinger Priests, branch of elemental damage, including [Avenger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Avenger), to be a later development, derived of Owlite research around elemental magic and sorcery (`An enchanting hood for knights who dabble in divination and contemplate conjuring` - [Magic Hood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magic_hood)), as _those carry imagery only existing in the Underworld_.

If at that point Legion of Ur would be sealed, it seems usage of trojan materials would be less possible or accessible, suggesting that explicitly Valkyrian armors were a product of earlier time, before Legion of Ur was sealed. More so, exstence of the [celetial ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore) might suggest, that fiendish material were not initially required for creation of those armors, but rather retroactively introduced to the concept of valkyries through means of alchemy as a phenomenon on Cradle, and out-of-universe narrative purposes.

While we have left relation of Owlites and Valkyries to celestial and angelic beings, [Seraphynx](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphynx), despite being a Kat-like battle sprite, has theme of divinity and skill labeled Angelic Aura, which can be turned into Seraphic Aura and Valkyrian Aura. This further links themes of the divine with Valkyries, despite those being manifested as an reincarnation of a Kat species from a battle sprite.

All of those parallels in design and internal logic, we believe, point to the idea of Owlites and valkyries being the same, or related, avian species. If they are related, Valkyries could be griffins, as the one implied in the description of [Gilded Griffin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin): `A beautiful pistol named after a great, noble beast. Its golden frame was believed to provide light within the impenetrable darkness of the Underworld`. A subtle element of this ambiguity is also found in the description of [Raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raiment_(Costume)): `A long, flowing battle garb best accessorized with a pair of angelic wings`.

This discrepancy in a supposed anatomy places valkyries as separate from Owlites, as the latter already have large wings. Moreover, it seems unconventional for Owlites as they are depicted to be armored in valkyrian armors - it is as meantioned, a plausible concept. Due to this we propose that __griffons are draconic ancestors for Valkyries, evolving from wyverns. Valkyries are the celestial beings, and Owlites are their descendants__.

This trajectory seems more promising as it allows for the thematic discrepancy of both, but _also allows griffins to exists within the lore_. This concept is also similar to our [analyzed relation between titans, tortomega, tortoises, and dragons](#tortomega-scenario), as all seem to be connected, but with a level of vagueness perpetually present among all.

#### Owlite Research of Undeath

Owlites also have researched ancient power of wind frenzy, finalized in the invention of the [Turbillion](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Turbillion), as suggested by presence of the [Owlite Feathers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_Feather) in its alchemy. Owlite more magic-directed armor and shields were designed to protect against specifically those elements, such suggesting alchemy tree of the [Owlite Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_Shield): `A sturdy shield similar to the sort said to have been carried by Owlite youth`. Alchemy tree of [Owlite Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_Shield), as well as many other Owlite, Valkyrian and Kat Tribe items have fiendish [brimstone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brimstone). As this is a material found in the Underworld-adjacent locations, it can also be attributed to a later period of time.

Alchemy has also been a common element, as its symbol, or rather symbol of alchemy orb, [is depicted](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/images/9/92/Divine_Tome_of_Rage-Equipped.png) on the [tome of rage front cover](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tome_of_rage).

This relates us back to the previous concept of alchemy and energy being universal, unless, Spiral Order managed to pass this knowledge, as they are known to master alchemy for a long time, discussed in [technology of Isorans](#technology-alchemy-and-Isoran-redesigns): `Spiral Order has relied on alchemy as their primary means of creating the very arsenals that Knights have relied upon for centuries` ([Alchemy for Beginners](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alchemy_for_Beginners)). We have to also consider that this tome is likely far older than most of Owlite civilization, as it was originally in the [Rage Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rage_Prize_Box), which had relation more so to Valkyries, than modern Owlites. This is also an argument is favour of valkyries being distinct from Owlites, which still had to be considered. On the other hand, given Valkyrian past, Owlites would have all chances to establish an Academy at the frontiers of alchemical study, which would allow for a plausible discovery of the Nameless Realm.

#### Forgotten Time

There exists a griffin-like species, as described by the [Gilded Griffin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin): `A beautiful pistol named after a great, noble beast. Its golden frame was believed to provide light within the impenetrable darkness of the Underworld`, yet, on the handgun itself there are dragons depicted and only [Argent Peacemaker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Argent_Peacemaker) and [Sentenza](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sentenza) alchemy paths have a creature with a beak.

We have previously pointed out this ambiguity, as it dictates the purpose of the handgun, but also the symbolic aspect of the creature, with which the purpose of the gun is associated - griffins.

Here, [Raptor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raptor), a predecessor of [Gilded Griffin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin) is also designed specifically to venture into the Underworld: `An ancient pistol imbued with enchantments designed to smite the fiendish creatures of the Underworld` ([Gilded Griffin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin)).

The key 2 elements of this branch of Antigua alchemy tree are _draconic design_ and _direct creation of the handguns to fight fiends of the Underworld_ as evident by their description.

Those who wielded it, did see the Underworld and likely were present, while griffins had existed _in order to assign them those characteristics_, as their exact properties are then reflected in the gun and linked with the Underworld. In that regard, the change from raptor to griffin may be due to a reason currently unknown.

We must note of a similar design in the Knight's battle sprite stats menu, where in its _food slot is located between 2 dragon heads_, the same as the arches of the floating castles, belonging to heavenly kingdom. This ties in with seemingly mythological position of dragons in Isoran culture. And if so, this pattern seems applicable to Antigua-derived handguns, as it is one argument for a proposal, that both civilizations are the same biological species or at least related by themes.

Then there are Antigua upgrades with imagery of a bird:

- `these handguns are said to have been wielded by 'gunslinger priests' during a now forgotten time` ([Silversix](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silversix)). The theme of divinity connected to those priests here was linked to the [Silvermail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silvermail). It is the first set, we believe, belongs to gunslinger priests. The other consists of [Argent Peacemaker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Argent_Peacemaker) and [Radiant Silvermail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Radiant_Silvermail).
- `Its bullets serve as ushers for those that refuse to leave this world` ([Argent Peacemaker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Argent_Peacemaker)). It is an upgrade of [Silversix](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silversix), and serves the same purpose to combat undead, with a distinguishing description of them being: `those that refuse to leave this world`.

  Owlite [Philoso Feather](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Philoso_Feather) in its crafting is notable, either being created by Owlites, or is the assumption of alchemy transcending logic and being more of a thematic link between items in a similar manner as the [dragon Scale Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale_Shield#Alchemy_Path) alchemy path, discussed earlier.

  Those two handguns within single alchemy path establish a concept of gunslinger priests, which, at least, know of undead family of monsters.

- `A shadow-aligned handgun of incredible power, its said to contain the soul of a knight who was only two days from retirement` ([Blackhawk](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blackhawk)). This handgun in particular has 3 elements to it:

  - It was wielded by a knight, so far leaning to Valkyrian knight, rather than Isoran. Whoever those knights are, shadow damage has prevailed there.
  - The [haunting](#haunting) as a tangible process, exists with involvement of souls bound to physical objects. In similar manner, souls are bound to skulls and [masks](#vanadukes-mask-and-immortality-span-classthrough-cursethrough-cursespan).
  - The `shadow-aligned handgun of incredible power` wording, stated the nature of the handgun, as it deals shadow damage, but also suggests that shadow damage is that `incredible power`, considering this damage type being far more unnatural compared to the rest.
  - The bird imagery, likely a hawk, also links us back to the elemental line of Antigua above - the Peacemaker.

- `An ancient handgun forged from shadow steel. It is said to have been wielded by an evil one who possessed "angel eyes"` ([Sentenza](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sentenza)). Shadow steel originates from the Underworld, and, as the handgun's design suggests, it was made near the same period of time as all of the above - with the hawk imagery. This notion can link thus handgun to the [Armor of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Armor_of_the_fallen), but, the western motif is rooted in a common media inspiration, which had to be accounted for.
- The [Chilling Duelist](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chilling_Duelist) is of the same design as the rest of Antigua alchemy tree, with the addition of ice, which may be attributed to elemental materials the gun is alchemized from. It is acquired from the [Deluxe Starter Pack](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deluxe_Starter_Pack), which also contains [Tri-Guard Set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tri-Guard_Armor): `A special suit of armor designed specifically for knights on first recon of alien planets. This rugged suit protects against a variety of harsh elements`. The armor seems more medieval compared to the rest, which might _attribute it to an earlier period of time of Isoran history so slightly_.

Gunslingers' sets have a similarity to the Antigua line, specifically the [gunslinger sash](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gunslinger_Sash) has mention of `forgotten time`: `Clothing worn by pistol-packing warriors from a forgotten time` ([gunslinger sash](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gunslinger_Sash)), as well as [Silversix](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silversix): `these handguns are said to have been wielded by 'gunslinger priests' during a now forgotten time`.

Considering the thematic element to both gunslinger set and Antigua, as they explicitly refer to a forgotten time, may be most solid argument to those being of the same period of time. But, this would also mean 2 things, or rather, scenarios:

- Isorans were already familiar with the Underworld, and had forgotten of it. They would also forget elemental damage, as it is one introduced currently by Owlites.
- As [Avenger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Avenger) is alchemized from the Sealed Sword, which is exchanged for Slime Token, same as [Antigua](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Antigua), whose alchemy tree refers to a forgotten time and seem to belong it: `A mysterious relic from a forgotten time`.

    So far we were leaning to an idea of Valkyries being those gunslinger priests, but emerging already by the time Valkyries invading Underworld.

Essentially, presence of western-themed equipment makes it more nuanced regarding the identity of gunslinger priests during the Forgotten Time. At that, we return to the _potential of Isorans being involved it this distinction of griffin and dragon-like designs_ of handguns.

##### Gunslingers From Isora

It is evident that at least [gunslinger sash](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gunslinger_Sash) and [Antigua](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Antigua) are connected. Both have a reference to a forgotten time and both being low-tech equipment from a different time.

This makes it seem that forgotten time is referring to Isorans mainly due to occasional mention of knights and general thematic attribution of guns to Spiral Order rather than valkyries. __In this interpretation forgotten time was on Isora before establishment of Spiral Order__.

Two questions emerge then in regards to this interpretation and an emerging timeline:

- If spirits are known to return to material realm, how undead managed to exist on Isora, unless it has similar metaphysic properties to Cradle?

  If it is on Isora, [as we had discussed](#cradle-metaphysics) a potential case of Core only allowing for spirits to return _in large scale_, the rest of those laws would remain the same and localized to specific phenomenon involving Underworld. But, this suggestion still would not explain the reason why modern Isorans would forget an entire realm, while interacting with its physics.

- Relation between Underworld and griffins remains unknown while dragons were established to be present on Isora. At that, angelic motif in Sentenza's description then becomes unrelated to the [Armor of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Armor_of_the_Fallen): `It is said to have been wielded by an evil one who possessed "angel eyes"` ([Sentenza](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sentenza)). Although this could also be a reference to popular culture.

    This popular culture-based explanation, we believe, should be able to function within the in-universe narrative by coupling armor and a handgun. If we attribute those items to Valkyries, we would decouple thematically grouped equipment to 2 different civilizations.

Valkyries are brought up here due to the most interaction with Underworld. Presented designs for the most part of the item roster _do not fit to the divine themes of valkyries_. Then it should be __Isorans, whose past was forgotten__ and who had to wield such equipment, as seen by mastery of guns amongst Spiral Order, as well as mention of forgotten time only in descriptions, alluding to the prior concept of those being written by Spiral Order.

In both proposals, there must be a _reason behind this time being labeled as forgotten_. That can be likely attributed to a sheer timescale Isorans have existed as a spacefaring civilization, as evident by gear of [Equinox Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Equinox_Prize_Box) described in the [spacefarers of old section](#spacefarers-of-old):

- `A special suit built to commemorate Isoran starfarers of old` ([Celestial Nav Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Nav_Suit)).
- `This suit was once worn by Isoran starfarers of eons long passed that stood watch over extrasolar operations` ([Stellar Sentinel Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stellar_Sentinel_Suit)).

As Isorans have existed for so long, they forgotten both elemental and shadow damage prevalent in the less technologically advanced era to how alchemy and occult in the modern world are perceived in fiction, - as lost knowledge.

But there is also a different connotation. If gunslingers are Isorans, this would mean that they had interacted with Underworld, which would not be forgotten as long as specie exists, as seen by previous iteration of Underworld interacting with the material realm. Shadow damage in that regard remains more as vague as it was for other civilizations when compared to definitive state of elemental damage as thoroughly studied and attributed to base alchemical elements as status effects.

The lack of awareness of Underworld for modern-day Isorans makes it seem to us that they did not encounter Underworld. But, _as we discussed [earlier](#spiral-wardens-and-trojans-similarity-part-1), Spiral Wardens design-wise are ones to be the foundation for the trojans of the Legion of Ur_, so at some point a _prolonged connection was established_. At the same time Valkyries are required to seal those trojans. There is also Fallen Valkyrian, whose deeds had him banished (`A cursed suit of armor once worn by a celestial being cast down from paradise` - [Armor of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Armor_of_the_fallen)). Due to that we see a connection between all of 3 parties:

- Isorans would encounter Underworld by the time of Spiral Order or at least Spiral Wardens were present, with the latter corrupted to trojans.
- Trojans are sealed in the Underworld by Valkyries. Trojans are created from Wardens by Underworld.
- Underworld remains unknown to Skylark crew and Isorans in general.
- Fallen Valkyrian somehow involved with those events. Given our proposal of [Trojan Horseshoe](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Trojan_Horseshoe) significance to Valkyrian recipes, Fallen Valkyrian has all of chances to be involved in this plot.

Here, this connection is probable through the alchemy path of Gilded Griffin, as its wielders had potentially been in the Underworld, as implied by the myth of a griffin shining a light on the Underworld.

Considering knights had remained as such, named as knights, the change in design of their military units under this narrative seems unlikely, leaving a room for Spiral Wardens, or simply wardens, to exist so far in the past.

The prior idea could be also supported by the more medieval design of tier 1 trojans, where we discussed the usage of redwood in their armor.

Lastly, given presence of "celestial" naming among Isorans, could it be, that Isorans are in fact that same species, as the celestial beings followed by Valkyries?

This proposal still would not explain the state of spirits in material realm on Isora and a lack of connection to the Underworld, but, it presents a [weird west](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdWest) __setting for gunslinger priests, which seems extremely fitting__. _It is due to this thematic consistency, presence of Isorans should be accounted for_.

##### Pre-Cradle Scenario

A variation of this proposal that explains gunslingers' nature, but also presence of undead and fiends - is the pre-Cradle scenario, wherein gunslingers are from a planet, which was used to build Cradle, and the one, [where the kingdom of Almire would fall](#chapter-vii-kingdom-of-almire).

_It characterizes western-themed gunslingers, as separate from gunslinger priests, to Isorans_, but allows for them to encounter Underworld.

It is the case of Isorans arriving at the same planet where Almire and Raiders would be present, as civilization, emerging from those first-generation Isorans, while still allowing a room for their transformation to trojans.

Presence of fiendish technology or magic, such as the [Blackened Shrine](#blackened-shrine-and-magma-deity), would only be fitting, as this would be framed as a continuation of myths, found across Isoran culture even in modern times, _originating from Isora_.

This case would require elaboration on [Sentenza](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sentenza), as presence of shadow steel would seal a connection of material realm and Underworld in relation, now, to Isorans. If so, [Shadowsun set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowsun_slicker) and its usage of shadow steel is paired with other shadow-aligned equipment, perpetuated by the Fallen Valkyrian in means of introducing shadow damage and resources from the Underworld. To those shadow-aligned guns we attribute [Blackhawk](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blackhawk) in this context would suggest, that this alignment to shadow was more widespread than it seems (`A shadow-aligned handgun of incredible power, its said to contain the soul of a knight who was only two days from retirement` - [Blackhawk](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blackhawk)).

On the contrary, [Deadshot Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadshot_Mantle) has shadow defenses, but is not attributed to any fiendish entity, having divine color scheme. _It also has curse resistance_. Its description, `A poncho for a pale rider with sights set on taking down the bad, ugly, undead denizens of the dark` - we suspect, refers both to undead and fiends, making it the set, plausible for pairing with [Gilded Griffin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin) _alchemy line_: `A beautiful pistol named after a great, noble beast. Its golden frame was believed to provide light within the impenetrable darkness of the Underworld`. Given prior discussion on presence of both motifs to this handgun, this seems to be a transitory point, alluding both to Valkyries and Isorans.

Apart from the color scheme, [Deadshot Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadshot_Mantle) design is reminiscent of [Divine Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Mantle), with both labeled as mantles, and not ponchos or cloaks. At that, one more similarity exists between them, of the circular spiral imagery:

- [Divine Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Divine_Mantle-Equipped.png) has on its front has 2 spiral circles at the bottom of the garb's symbol.
- [Deadshot Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Deadshot_Mantle-Equipped.png) has the same as above spiral circles but at the bottom front of the mantle instead of the garb.

So far, the __keystone design element to this distinction is tied to 2 groups of handguns__:

- Handguns with the __depiction of dragons__ are _relating to Isoran culture_, those are regular knights. Divine aspect here is linked to the following.
- Handguns with the __depiction of griffins__ are a _product of Valkyrian culture_ and connected to dragons' descendants, wyverns. With general themes of Valkyries, those have higher chance of being the aforementioned gunslinger priests due to spiritual theme.

This distinction reminds us of [different depictions of the evil eye](#evil-eye) by Devilites and Titans.

##### Valkyrian Gunslingers

As many promotional items are seen in the context of Spiral Order and Isorans equipping them, same can be told of gunslinger items.

At the same time, no piercing damage weaponry currently exists, which could be attributed to valkyries, assuming, they had both close and ranged combat techniques.

In this interpretation [Avenger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Avenger) had to be created already with the knowledge of curse and of sealing, to be utilized to fight undead. Since Valkyries are ones to seal Legion of Ur, we can position this skill at least by that later period of time. But, since [Gran Faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gran_Faust) also transmuted from the [Sealed Sword](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sealed_Sword), we suggest it being created later into the timeline, while it still belonging to Fallen Valkyrian, potentially placing him to that period of time as the Legion of Ur being sealed. This brings up an idea of [Sealed Sword](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sealed_Sword) being created in the first place by someone - `A mysterious sword of great untapped potential. It hums with raw power`.

This proposal leans to an idea of gunslinger priests emerging some time after introduction of Isorans, transformation of Warden to trojans, and near the incursion into the Underworld. All of those factor seem to us as follows: __Valkyries are closely related to Owlites by habitat, but through symbolism and design they resemble Spiral Order__.

Where gunslinger priests would fit within this framework?

#### Gunslinger Priests: Part 1

As we have exhausted here most of the leads, apart from a later period of time, coinciding with the application of warding candles, we can now begin to outline a solution for this period of time - coupling majority of the inconsistencies, loose definitions, and anachronisms through common themes, built upon these hints.

Forgotten time is distinct and early period of time, involving gunslingers on a planet, where undeath would be prevalent and fought against.

Those gunslinger were, initially, Isorans, who have crash landed on this planet, eventually resulting in 3 kingdom. But before this, Underworld was uncovered, as its presence was felt in the mountains of the kingdom of Almire. We previously proposed, that it is connected to [magmatic fanatics](#blackened-shrine-and-magma-deity), which were the reason for shrine's construction.

But, given Lord Vanaduke's crusade did put an end to the war of 3 kingdoms, we suspect that most of this land was rendered uninhabitable. Such interpretation allows us to consider Valkyries invading the Underworld for that reason, as it was Legion of Ur and Lord Vanaduke's curse which caused this, showing the scale of destruction Legion of Ur was capable of.

This would place an incursion of Valkyries into the Underworld after kingdom of Almire had fallen. But, as this period of time was better explored, and no evidence of guns were found, we have placed the forgotten time into the past before medieval themes of Isorans were properly formed as they are explored in the analysis of those kingdoms.

During Almire, none of those kingdoms were familiar with the undeath or shadow damage, as they did not know of elemental defenses nor damage, apart from [volcanic gear](#volcanic-elements), but they knew of normal and piercing:

- For kingdom of Ironmight: [Ironmight set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironmight_Plate_Mail)
- For kingdom of Almire: [Almirian Crusader Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_Crusader_Armor), [Volcanic Plate set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Mail).
- For gunslingers: [Antigua](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Antigua), [Justifier Jacket](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Justifier_Jacket)
- For raiders: [Squall Caller](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Squall_Caller), [Winter's Edge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Winter%27s_Edge)

Due to this, we have suggested, that there are no civilizations left after Almire, apart from heavenly kingdom, to be aware of other damage types. This reasoning also tied us to the idea of  Isorans being at the center of this plot.

As undeath remains vague in its in-Universe laws, we have attributed gunslinger priests to this period of time. Undead would not be encountered up until first interactions with the Underworld for Isorans and the second time for Valkyries, as the latter did witness Underworld during reign of Titans.

Through currently unknown means, Isorans did uncover Underworld and undeath, separately from their homeworld, Isora. This event has ended with the creation of the Legion of Ur from corrupted Wardens. Legion of Ur then had initiated a conquest into the Underworld, remaining there, but not being sealed: `A crest from the lost Legion of Ur, an elite band of fiendish warrior said to have once conquered the Underworld. Whomever holds it can faintly hear the sound of drums and the clomping of hooves` ([Crest of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crest_of_Ur)).

As Isorans were connected to Underworld through this plot, and as they had a possibility of possessing divine-themed equipment, we may suggest, that it was a later creation. While this seems odd, we attributed it to the similarity of handguns with depiction of griffins and dragons. This would not yet tie back to creation of gunslinger priests, who did fought undead, and later had experiences of reaching Underworld.

The rest of non-undead-focused gear would be attributed to either, precursors to gunslinger priests comprised of Isorans, wielding [Raptor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raptor) alchemy line and [Deadshot Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadshot_Mantle), and only later Valkyries, who have remade Antigua to griffin-themed variants. Those recreations would be paired in [Silvermail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silvermail) and [Silversix](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silversix) as definitive sets of a gunslinger priests' armor for combatting the undead.

Here, [Blackhawk](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blackhawk) and [Sentenza](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sentenza) are then paired with [Shadowsun set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowsun_Slicker) through a scenario of a persistent focus of Isorans on shadow-damage due to Sentenza being attributed to Fallen Valkyrian, despite the decopling of themes brought from the source material. As for [Sentenza](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sentenza), specifically, as it is stated to be forged from shadow steel `An ancient handgun forged from shadow steel`, seems to be created in the Underworld, similar to [Faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Faust) alchemy line: `A powerful, cursed sword forged in the underworld` (`An upgraded Faust forged from pristine-quality shadow steel. Its charge attacks are powerful enough to curse its wielder, but that hasn't stopped Devilites from treasuring these rare blades even more highly than their meager vacation time` - [Gran Faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gran_Faust)).

And with this, we have attributed creation of [Avenger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Avenger), as a creation of Owlites _through the usage of sealing magic and inversion of curse_, to a lter period of time, derived of past experiences with curse specifically for heavenly kingdom. At that, we propose, Avenger being a result of Owlite research in the Academy, in attempt to invert Gran Faust's curse-bearing property from the sword, reusing it againt Underworld.

This interpretation seems far more complex, as it _introduces for the second time element of cultural adoption of foreign symbols_. But with this, we consider those events to be tied, necessitating Underworld, Valkyries, and Isorans to be present with all of the above requirements in out understanding and research.

It was not yet the time valkyries carried out their own incursion, but rather its Isoran wardens which were the victims of this connection to the Underworld, leading to creation of Legion of Ur. And only later Valkyries would carry out their own expedition into the Underworld, one characterized, or likely, initialized by the actions of a figure of fallen valkyrian, now only known as the Fallen, based on the [Armor of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Armor_of_the_Fallen). Thise scenario requires for early Isorans to discover shadow damage and direct connection to Underworld through some means. Those means, as a metter of fact, we believe, is the motivation of the Fallen Valkyrian.

##### Fantasy-Themed Undeath

It is during this _more fantasy_ as well as _weird western-themed_ period of time [Cold Iron Carver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Carver) and [Cold Iron Vanquisher](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Vanquisher) would be invented, as they all have now familiar imagery of the evil eye, as well as a focus on slaying the undead: `A powerful cold iron blade forged for the singular purpose of hunting down and destroying the undead` [Cold Iron Vanquisher](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Vanquisher). Given its alchemy path from [Calibur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tempered_Calibur), it mirrors the same pattern of Almirian armor being a more ancient depiction of Isoran order. And it is here we attribute this blade to the same period of time characterized by this focus on more fantasy-themed appearances and undeath.

Vanquisher and [Cold Iron Carver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Carver) in that regard is one with a particular imagery of __a horned skull with a single eye__, reminiscent of titans in their most powerful period of time, _depicted on the Arcade Gates_, considering, that it is a helm which was interpreted as a skull. Vanquisher's alchemy path has normal damage, but is designed to smite undead, which would also fit under the logic of early period of time, wherein [Isorans, would eventually discover Vog, and build magmatic shrines](#blackened-shrine-and-magma-deity). How Underworld would be discovered by Isorans may be hidden in this connection to Titans.

Vanquisher also has chains as part of the design, which we have pointed out for Lord Vanaduke's armor, suggesting it to be his literal soul-prison. So, those design to arrive from far older period of time seems as more thematically fitting, giving those element a reason to be present.

We also propose, that it is during this period of time more modern iterations of Tortomega's Troika would be invented - [Triglav](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Triglav) as one containing Underworld's everfrost, and [Sudaruska](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sudaruska). Both are normal damage weapons but possess a subtle aspect of magic, similar to the aforementioned [Cold Iron Vanquisher](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Vanquisher).

Those weapons only could've been invented with the knowledge of Underworld. At that, as [Troika](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Troika) alchemy tree is presented here, we suggest this period existing on the same planet as tortodrones' or titans' civilization.

The thing that is left ambiguous then - why heavenly kingdom became involved so late into the events of Lord Vanaduke's return? Possible explanation for it could be the idea of heavenly kingdom being either not concerned with those events unless a direct threat would be presented, given how Almire has remained untouched, or how Legion of Ur had to be sealed only later.

Lastly, the presence of undead on this preceding planet had to be also explained. In the analysis of [Cradle metaphysics](#cradle-metaphysics) we proposed, that those laws of undeath existed before the Core, explaining it here, but not answering a question of why native Isorans hadn't encountered Underworld.

A less plausible solution may stem from the idea of Troika, before it was developed into its 5-star variants, had required for those ancient Isorans to stumble upon fallen kingdom of Titans, and through this discovering the Underworld, which ties to the period of time, characterized by more obfuscated concepts comprising the Forgotten Time.

#### Divinity and Alchemical Gold

Here we should also touch upon the small theme of gold and divinity connection:

- As [Gilded Griffin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin) is described: `Its golden frame was believed to provide light within the impenetrable darkness of the Underworld`.
- _Golden_ [battle sprite harness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Harness) deals piercing damage, but can't be equipped on Drakon, with the same damage type inconsistency of piercing damage of Morai armor and [Riftlocker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Riftlocker) used by the Spiral Order.

We believe, this motif is related to alchemy, as gold was considered pure, divine metal, representing physical and spiritual perfection, and one, which, but on a different matter would serve on par with silver in opposition to Shadow Steel of Underworld.

And, as for the handguns of ths period of time, [Argent Peacemaker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Argent_Peacemaker) would be invented by Owlites in their research. Owlite Academy Of Macgics were at the frontier of elemental research, which would become prominent as we will cover the Fallen Valkyrian.

All of those similarities make it seem for us as if all those cultures were deeply intertwined at some point in time, in the similar manner to the existence of [heavy statues](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Statue#Heavy_Statue). This would resolve both in-game status resistances, as an argument for physiological similarities, and also symbolic and thematic parallels.

#### Celestial Kingdom

One last suggestion, which could back this convoluted chain of event, a potential explanation for the identity of heavenly kingdom, is the inspiration by the Celestial Kingdom of Chinese Mythology.

Celestial kingdom is ruled by the Jade Emperor. Queen Mother of the West is the guardian of souls, of the spiritual realm, and represents the balance of nature. This description is most reminiscent of the Spirit Mother. Within the Celestial Kingdom reside spirits, which is similar to our understanding of the Nameless Realm, albeit with western alchemical ideas.

There are the Four Heavenly Kings. Despite the title, they are guardians of Heavens, protecting the Celestial Kingdom from even entering. [Oni Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Oni_Helm) has similar description of a fiend: `Designed to frighten their enemies, this helm is in the visage of a fiend who lives in the mountains of a distant land. Said to guard the gate to heaven itself, it only allows those who are worthy to pass`.

Those similarities seem intentional, distinguished from the general themes and motifs across many different mythos, apart from Christianity, which, as will will further discuss, has its prevalence. This, we believe, still marks a distinction between physiology of celestial beings in the context of Spiral Knights, and ones within the material realm, extrapolated onto many different species.

More so, we have previously covered divine themes of Valkyries through relation to wording of seraphic or angelic, suggesting a transition from the divine to material.

Considering that, as well as our previous discussions of Valkyries being griffins, a solution could be proposed, that Owlites identical to Valkyries in the material realm, and Valkyries are only refered as such by being an army of heavenly kingdom.

By that time Owlite academy is to be established and used to create elemental gear for gunslinger priests, as well as making greater accent on magic and power of sealing the curse. This would lead Legion of Ur being sealed at least after Lord Vanaduke's crusade.

#### Knights of the Rose

One of the last remaining elements of this forgotten time, we propose, are the Knights of the Rose. Their nature-themed design and naming is present as one other instance from a similar period of time of medieval Europe.

Knight of the Rose are described in the [Tabard of the Rose](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tabard_of_the_Prismatic_Rose#Tabard_of_the_Prismatic_Rose): `An aged, embroidered tabard that once belonged to a Knight of the Rose, a sacred order of brave and especially dashing heroes whose numerous adventures are the subject of many folk tales. The Knights of the Rose were said to be peerless fencers, believing that their blades were like the flowers of their name: a delicate thing of beauty that hides a vicious sting`.

As they are described as fencers, the only equipment that could potentially fit to them is the [Flourish](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flourish) alchemy tree.

The [Fowl Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fowl_Cloak) of [Rooster Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rooster_Prize_Box) is the bringing element to tabards and Strangers as it has the same pattern weaved on cloth as a few Haven canopies ([Fowl Set pattern](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Brown_Fowl-Set.png)).

Similar to the cloak, [tabards of the rose](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tabard) of [Rose Regalia Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rose_Regalia_Prize_Box) and a [letter](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/95665). It is important to note meaning of tabard - a type of coat being worn in late middle ages Europe, used both in and out of military context.

Fencers' armor designs are similar to Fowl's which are the same as the patterns on canopies across [Haven](#strangers-and-haven). This fact, as well as nature motif of knights of the Rose, we believe, makes it seem that knight of the rose were Almirians.

The question is, how Vaelyn, for example, had in her possession her Grand Flourish and Final Flourish?

An explanation can be presented here, as with gunslingers and regular close-combat knights, their weapons, their designs, fencers were also present on Isora with the rest of first generation of Isorans, but only after crash landing they attained the distinctive natural theming, reminiscent of kingdom of Almire.

The fact that Stranger have those designs prior to arrival of Spiral Order during game's events is important, as it suggest that a large period of time has passed since. Otherwise there would be no reason for Spiral Order to take Strangers' designs as the basis for tabards', including their framing as something coming, yet again, from the past.

#### Fallen Valkyrian

We believe, Fallen Valkyrian is the reason why heavenly kingdom invaded Underworld in the first place, and then of sealing the Legion of Ur.

We would not attempt to understand Fallen's motivation or reasoning, as there is practically no information on him. But one thing, we believe is certain, - __what was done by him, had rippling effects large enough, so that he had to be banished__.

Based on the designs of the armor, and its recipes, we can attempt to piece together what happened back then:

- `A cursed suit of armor once worn by a celestial being cast down from paradise` ([Armor of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Armor_of_the_fallen)).
- `A cursed crown once worn by a celestial being cast down from paradise` ([Crown of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crown_of_the_Fallen)).

The `celestial` characteristic is one used to refer to valkyries in the [Heavenly Iron Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Helm) description: `A powerful helm said to be crafted from angelic shields. It retains many divine properties celestial beings possess but lacks their weakness to fire`.

The paradise in that regard, as it takes more religious connotation, is the heavenly kingdom, the Scarlet Fortress being what remains of it. And it seems to us fitting from current themes, that this narrative parallels to a religious one. With this, __this heavenly kingdom, or paradise, and Asgard, seem to be located in a realm above material realm, while allowing more matter from the material realm, as castles, comprising the kingdom__.

In that context, [Sentenza](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sentenza), as it is forged from Shadow Steel, seems to belong to the Fallen Valkyrian instead of the Shadowsun set. This would decouple it from the [Shadowsun Slicker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowsun_Slicker), which is an issue, but, we can attribute, as stated earlier, [Blackhawk](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blackhawk) to this set. But, given recent elemnts of more fantasy-themed eauipment, one could argue, that even shadow western-themed equipment had existed at that time, and that wouldbe a valid propal, and one far more simple.

We have a reason to consider the aforementioned heavenly kingdom as one located in a different realm due to the multi-dimensional property of the proposed cosmology - so that a biblical event, such as banishment of the Fallen, would involve at least 2 realms. And given lack of presence of material realm, and opposition of the latter 2, it seems that there are 3 dimensions to be involved in this conflict.

As Fallen was banished into the Underworld, Valkyries had head an incursion into Underworld, and then sealed both the Fallen and the Legion of Ur (`Strangely, the memo indicated that the Legion of Ur was sealed away in the Underworld and that an alternative approach would be required for bringing them back` - [The Return of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur)). [Crest of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crests_of_Ur) contains an addition to this hypothesized timeline of events: `A crest from the lost Legion of Ur, an elite band of fiendish warrior said to have once conquered the Underworld. Whomever holds it can faintly hear the sound of drums and the clomping of hooves`, in which we linked sound of drums to the sound of drum during Lord Vanaduke's transformation: `With this he began screaming the names of the rival kings and all the wrongs they committed against his kingdom. He cried out to the god of the mountain to punish them, to give him the strength to take his kingdom back. In his frenzy he looked to the face of the deity and in it he began to see the face deform. The image burned into his eyes and brain like cinders, and contained that which sounded like the screaming of foreign tongues and war drums` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall)), as __war drums being characteristic of Underworld's influence onto living beings__.

This Crest has 2 notable properties: the supernatural presence of trojans and the fact legion of Ur had conquered the Underworld. The supernatural presence of trojans is similar to Snarbolax's equipment curse properties:

- `Those who wield it claim to feel the fiery stare of the beast upon them whenever they close their eyes` ([Barbarous Thorn Blade](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Barbarous_Thorn_Blade)).
- `Its said the beast can use the glowing orbs on the shield's face to see and stalk weak-hearted wielders`([Barbarous Thorn Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Barbarous_Thorn_Shield))

And, as discussed in [Snarbolax and empowerment through curse section](#snarbolax-and-haunting-through-curse), all those instances of haunting in varying severity are explained by the unnatural, from the position of material realm, properties.

It is said that the legion had conquered the Underworld, and based on the above information, was sealed there. We also concluded that it is the same army Lord Vanaduke had led when he returned from the erupting volcanic mountains.

As our theory suggests that trojans are wardens, so their arrival is fitting here, but this would also mean that one had to lead them - a lack of Legion's commander.

At that point we would suggest that this figurehead would be the Fallen Valkyrian, as this type of power shift, rippling through time, would be a reason for a banishment for the Fallen under this framing. This means that the Fallen's name is Ur once he remained in the Underworld with an identity of a commander of Underworld elite legion.

We also suspect, that, _as Arkus was transforming into a fiend, so was the Fallen_, given his affinity with fiends through armor's stats.

Apart from them, there is [Crown of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crown_of_the_Fallen), as it has a shadowy halo, similar to one in [Valkyrie Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Helm). And, as Valkyrian armors have [Trojan Horseshoe](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Trojan_Horseshoe) as a fiendish material in their recipe, this, we suppose, points to high importance of this event of banishment and connection to the Legion of Ur of all parties from that period of time.

One last element for this idea is the ownership of [Champion Helms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Champion_Helm) of rage, frenzy and storms. As we discussed, tortomega are unlikely candidates, but at that time no other civilization could claim ownership of the gear, apart from valkyries themselves. And at that time they did not have any known internal conflicts. But now, as there is an event which caused a valkyrian to be banished, we can suggest that this valkyrian had its own followers, armed with such equipment. And, coincidentally, the wording - `The helm of one who defied the gods and razed the gates of a heavenly kingdom` ([Frenzy Champion Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Champion_Helm#Frenzy_Champion_Helm)) reminds now of the Fallen Valkyrian, as one opposing heavens.

### _Chapter `VIII`_ Kat Tribe

The events preceding Kataclysm take place after the fall of the kingdom of Almire and sealing of Legion of Ur in the Underworld.

While tortomega or titans [are long gone](#the-titans-tortomega-the-fall), and Almire itself [had turned into ashen land](#blackened-shrine-and-magma-deity) with the inclusion of the former kingdoms around it, at that point only heavenly kingdom remains with inhabiting it Valkyries and Owlites. The raiders are absent at that point. In relation to [Operation Gelid](#operation-gelid-and-other-methods-of-escaping-cradle), it could be plausible for them to survive for some time in the northern regions of the planet. Given events of Operation Gelid, they too could've fallen to Underworld's influence.

Kingdom of Almire was described in multiple tomes within the established Owlite Academy of Magicks, further affirming its status as an important location for heavenly kingdom serving as a library and a research center.

The [Forgotten Library](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_tome_text_Dialogue/The_Forgotten_Library), wherein first written texts about kingdom of Almire were found by Spiral Order, is located in the halls of the High Academy of magicks, now known as the Candlestick Keep. Apart from it we are aware of the research-oriented aspect of heavenly kingdom proper, implied by existence of the [Eternal Study](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Area-Time_Enough_at_Last-Eternal_Study.png) within the Scarlet Fortress during the events of [Time Enough at Last](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Time_Enough_at_Last).

After the events of Valkyries invading the Underworld, [without gunslinger priests](#griffin-dragon-distinction-a-proposal), many fiend-related discoveries were made, we can identify those by their recipes, which contain either undead or fiendish materials.

At some point in the past, near the period of time when gunslinger priests were established, Philoso, an Owlite magician and wizard, was born (`A large, grey feather plucked from the greatest of the Owlite magicians` [Philoso Feather](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Philoso_Feather)). He is responsible for many developments of Owlites' research on elemental damage application in combat and defense. Evident by gear made with his [feathers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Philoso_Feather#Usage), __he was specializing in elemental combat against the Undead__. And, we suppose he was the founder of gunslinger priests, given his significance as an individual, uncovered by Spiral Order. His position as an Owlite relates back to the relation of _Owlites and Valkyries as far descendants of dragons, wyverns, and finally griffins_, with griffins being direct ancestors of Valkyries.

We have discussed this relation in the [first intermission](#intermission-gunslinger-priests-of-forgotten-time), paralleling [relation](#chapter-iii-ancient-titans) between _dragons, drakes, tortoises, and finally tortomega_, - the latter being the civilization of titans, annihilated by Undercorp.

Those undead, against which an organization of gunslinger priests was formed to fight, were part of Underworld army during the time, labelled as forgotten, after Isorans had discovered Underworld for the first time, as Fallen Valkyrian was involved and Legion of Ur was created, as per [analysis gunslinger priests appearing in the timeline](#fallen-valkyrian).

During that period of time:

- Owlite [Divine Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Mantle) being the result of incorporation knowledge of curse into divine aspect of Owlite elemental advancements.
- Upgraded [Divine Avenger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_avenger) __being a prime case of negation and inversion of curse__ of Gran Faust through application of Seals.
- A handgun, [Argent Peacemaker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Argent_Peacemaker) and entirety of griffin-themed line of handguns being developed by Owlites with assistance of Isoran gunslingers to combat undead, known as gunslinger priests.
- [Radiant Silvermail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Radiant_Silvermail) and [Silvermail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silvermail) were devised to assist Valkyries in the Underworld, with Silvermail and [Silversix](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silversix) lines of equipment being the gunslinger priests' standard equipment.
- Initial creation of [Omegaward](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omegaward) we attribute to Owlites, as no other civilization would be as skilled in elemental damage mastery as Owlites.
- [Deadly Crystal Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadly_Crystal_Bomb) with application of Valestone mixed with Moonstone is characteristic of [Owlite-specific ritual circles, later found in the Moorcroft Manor](#moorcroft-manor-past-heavenly-kingdom).
- [Owlite shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_Shield) and [Grey Feather set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Feather_Mantle) being developer with the same derived oif elemental mastery knowledge by Owlites.

We propose, that exactly Philoso's research after Legion of Ur was sealed had led to the discovery of the Nameless Realm, based on the presence of Crest of Ur in alchemy of the [Chaos Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_Cloak), with the subtle _imagery of the antique evil eye_, seen in [Heavy Statues, deeply related to Titans](#evil-eye). The very fact, that is is _stated to be forbidden_, seems to us as the invention too dangerous even for the heavenly kingdom. It can be argued, that Valkyrian armor also has fiendish materials, which is true, but, given presence of curse, we consider this development from later period of time, given more widespread Dread Seal symbolism around Owlites and undead.

This ties back to a specific point in time, which marks introduction of the evil eye in the form of [Dread Seal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Seal) as one applied in Owlite magic. This should align with the creation of [Avenger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Avenger), as it would be created from the [Sealed Sword](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sealed_Sword), supposedly stollen [Gran Faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gran_Faust) (` that hasn't stopped Devilites from treasuring these rare blades even more highly than their meager vacation time` - [Gran Faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gran_Faust)), as it is deeply tied to curse. And, Sealed Sword was sealed with the same [paper dread seal as Lumbers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Monster-Redward.png), who, as we discussed, were constructed by gremlins, who also work with shadow damage, but to a far lesser extent.

The nature of Sealed Sword, its upgrades is one of more notable element to the nature of curse overall as well as more direct depictions of capacity and limits to transform and reapply it in same manner - like the Divine Avenger alchemy path.

Application and origin of the [Dread Seal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Seal) will be covered in consideration of Carnavons, which will be analyzed later in the context of Shadow Lairs.

After the Fallen Valkyrian was banished, after Almire had fallen, and after Legion of Ur was sealed, within this relatively stable period of time, as not much is known to happen there, _Kat tribe emerges_.

#### Siege of the Academy

Owlites are related to vengeance, which, considering their relation to valkyries, is fitting (`A resplendent replica of the shield thought to have been issued to the most eminent of Owlite wizards. Wielding it fills you with righteous vengeance` - [Grey Owlite Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Owlite_Shield)).

Kat Tribe, or at least, invasion of the Academy was led by Margrel: `A reclaimed raiment that is brimming with dark energy. It is said to resemble the great Kat Tribe hero, Margrel, the one who opened The Book of Grey Feathers and brought about the Kataclysm. It brings great misfortune to anyone who dares to wear it` ([Black Kat Raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat_Raiment)). It is also known, that not all kats are literate: `It appears that illiteracy is still rampant among the black kat hordes, so they have once more taken to eating the pilfered pages rather than using them for arcane rituals` ([Kataclysmic Confrontation!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/100025)) and `Black kats are the darkest souls of the former Kat Tribe. They carry the heaviest curse of all and mindlessly seek to devour magical auras. This constant consuming of power makes them incredibly strong. They were likely attracted to the power radiating from the ancient grimoires here in the Archives` ([Kataclysmic Confrontation - Pembrooke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke#Dialogue)). _General perception of Black Kats makes impression of a metaphorical exchange of mental capacities to raw magical, or curse-driven, powers of Black Kats_, when compared to the Mewkats or [Spookats](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spookat#Spookat).

Then there is an establishment of inner structure of their army during the siege of the academy:

- Frontline soldiers, "Clawers" - `An impressive mask instilled with the might of Kat Clawers, the fearsome frontline fighters of the Kat Tribe` ([Kat Claw Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Claw_Mask)) as they are referred as warriors: `A crudely crafted cloak made to resemble a cut-throat warrior of the ill-fated Kat Tribe` ([Kat Claw Cloak]( https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Claw_Cloak)).
- Grenadiers, "Seekers" - `An impressive mask instilled with the might of Kat Seekers, the skillful grenadiers of the Kat Tribe` ([Kat Eye Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Eye_Mask)), `A crudely crafted cloak made to resemble a crack shot warrior of the ill-fated Kat Tribe` ([Kat Eye Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Eye_Cloak)).
- Demolition engineers, "Hissers" - `An impressive mask instilled with the might of Kat Hissers, the unstable bombers of the Kat Tribe` ([Kat Hiss Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Hiss_Mask)), `A crudely crafted cloak made to resemble a temperamental warrior of the ill-fated Kat Tribe` ([Kat Hiss Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Hiss_Cloak)).
- Sappers - `A crudely crafted cloak made to resemble a shadowy sapper of the ill-fated Kat Tribe` ([Black Kat Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat_Cloak)).
- Sleeper cells, "Nappers" - `An impressive mail instilled with the might of Kat Nappers, the undercover sleeper cell of the Kat Tribe` ([Black Kat Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat_Mail)). This implies presence of Kats, as own species, among Owlites, which would be considered separate from Kat Tribe.

With this, we can identify specialists of the Kat Tribe:

- Torair, an engineer - `A reclaimed raiment said to resemble the Kat Tribe hero, Torair, who clung to the gates of the Owlite High Academy of Magicks as both it and his explosives burned` ([Kat Hiss Raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Hiss_Raiment)).
- Preowa, grenadier commander - `A reclaimed raiment said to resemble the Kat Tribe hero, Preowa, whose artillery silenced the Grey Feather Tower Sages` ([Kat Eye Raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Eye_Raiment)).
- Scraith, may be identified as a member of initial assault forces, given his equipment matching Clawers' - `A reclaimed raiment said to resemble the Kat Tribe hero, Scraith, first to scale the walls of the Owlite High Academy of Magicks` ([Kat Claw Raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Claw_Raiment)).

This suggests a general plan of attack at the academy: _as explosives were planted at the front gates of the academy, it was infiltrated over castle walls, while the artillery was used to target Grey Feather Tower_.

Then, as the academy was breached, Margrel has entered the location where Book of Grey Feathers was held:

- `A cursed cowl that is brimming with dark energy. It is said to resemble the great Kat Tribe hero, Margrel, the one who opened The Book of Grey Feathers and brought about the Kataclysm. It brings great misfortune to anyone who dares to wear it` ([Black Kat Cowl](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat_Cowl))
- `A reclaimed raiment that is brimming with dark energy. It is said to resemble the great Kat Tribe hero, Margrel, the one who opened The Book of Grey Feathers and brought about the Kataclysm. It brings great misfortune to anyone who dares to wear it` ([Black Kat Raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat_Raiment))
- `A whisker won from the great Kat Tribe hero, Margrel. They were traditionally worn as a ward against Owlite magics but now represent the triumph of goodly magical arts over evil` ([Wicked Whisker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wicked_Whisker))

Based on [Black Kat Raiment's design](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat_Raiment) as a cursed armor, [Margrel's design](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Margrel), [Black Kats' design](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grimalkin#Black_Kat), as well as [Seraphynx](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphynx) battle sprite, we can guess approximate presentation of Kats:

- Coat pattern of [Kat Hiss Cowl](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Hiss_Cowl) looks same as the siamese variant of [Seraphynx](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphynx_(Siamese)).
- Inverted color scheme of [Kat Eye Cowl](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Eye_Cowl) resembles the tabby [Seraphynx](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphynx_(Tabby)).
- [Kat Claw Cowl](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Claw_Cowl) does not have a relevant fur coat pattern for Seraphynx.

At that, we should note presence of an __antique evil eye symbolism across Kat armor__. Weather the eye symbolism has emerged during alchemy by Spiral Order or was innate property of armors as part of Kat Tribe culture, will be eventually discussed.

#### Grey Feather Tower

With, supposedly, variation of that equipment, Kat Tribe had invaded Owlite High Academy of Magicks. Discussing the Academy, one particular naming convention of _Grey Feathers_ is present there in 3 instances:

- `A reclaimed raiment said to resemble the Kat Tribe hero, Preowa, whose artillery silenced the Grey Feather Tower Sages` ([Kat Eye Raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Eye_Raiment)). A tower within the Academy is established.
- `A cloak for renowned Owlite scholars, this feathery frock is filled with the wisdom of the ages` ([Grey Feather Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Feather_Mantle)) belonging to renowned Owlite scholars, likely those in the Grey Feather Tower.
- `A cursed cowl that is brimming with dark energy. It is said to resemble the great Kat Tribe hero, Margrel, the one who opened The Book of Grey Feathers and brought about the Kataclysm. It brings great misfortune to anyone who dares to wear it` ([Black Kat Cowl](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat_Cowl)).

We will attempt to locate Grey Feather Tower, considering the medieval castle-like theme of heavenly kingdom and of Owlites, onto the general medieval, 9-15th century castle plan with considerations of the tower's purpose. The case of Kat Tribe utilizing artillery may suggest a period of time with an upper boundary, which parallels more widespread application of artillery in sieges of castles. Due to this we should also reconsider a time period of gunslinger priests' establishment, to whom we will return later.

Under this logic we can suggest 2 places for the tower: as one to the castle's dungeon, usually the highest tower to house most of castle's army, or the central keep itself. The keep is the most protected, inner structure of the castle, wherein castle's ruler chambers, living quarters, and treasury are located. The dungeon is predominantly used as the quarters and armory for the castles army.

But, as the aesthetics of the narrative and depth-dependant design are paramount here, same as the design of Firestorm Citadel - that of the general idea of the Owlite Academy being a castle-like structure, we would not focus of this detail apart from the location of the Book of Grey Feathers, but rather relations between known items, equipment and descriptions.

Although coincidentally, the location of the academy is referred to as the Candlestick Keep, which may potentially refer to the keep of the academy being the location Knights were traversing, potentially even Grey Feather tower itself. So far we have no evidence to precisely identify its details. As there are spookats inhabiting the keep, we may suggest that the moment Kataclysm struck, those members of Kat Tribe were still in the academy.

#### Nature of Owlite Tomes

At that, considering the following events of Kataclysm, and the motif of a [single item capable of exiting in its multiple iteration through alchemy although under different names](#vanadukes-mask-and-immortality-through-curse), we can hypothesize, that _the Book of Dark Rituals is the very Book of Grey Feathers_, considering the scope of the effects it causes when [ill-used in the Moorcroft Manor](#moorcroft-manor-past-heavenly-kingdom).

Despite this vagueness, we can suggest, that _the location of the Book of Grey Feathers was in the Grey Feather Tower_, given its naming convention. It is then the book itself, whose nature and abilities remain unknown:

- `[Black kats] carry the heaviest curse of all and mindlessly seek to devour magical auras. This constant consuming of power makes them incredibly strong. They were likely attracted to the power radiating from the ancient grimoires here in the Archives` ([Pembrooke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke#Dialogue)).
- `These shadowy beasts hunger for arcane power and raided the Moorcroft Manor Archives' precious collection of magical grimoires. In the wrong hands these ancient tomes could be catastrophic, ... The residents of Moorcroft Manor would like you to retrieve the Ancient Pages of the magical grimoires that quite likely reside in the stomachs of Black Kats` ([Kataclysmic Confrontation! - Path Notes: 2013.01.30](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/73222)).

##### Magical Auras

Based on those descriptions of Owlite tomes we can make a guess, that the auras are bound to Owlite tomes, - that the books themselves contain this raw power which can cause the Kataclysm itself: `In the wrong hands these ancient tomes could be catastrophic, but it turns out that Black Kats can't read` ([Kataclysmic Confrontation! - Path Notes: 2013.01.30](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/73222)). And, as the pages are the ones returned to Montague, it is likely the pages themselves contain the auras, but it is unknown weather the fact _Owlite text itself, the glyphs on those pages, is what grants them an aura_, attracting Black Kats, _or it is the property of the books themselves_.

We believe it is important in order to better understand the concept of auras, which we had discussed previously in the [Auras and Souls section](#auras-and-souls). Even more interesting is the property of [fiendish glyphs to possess inner power](#fiendish-glyphs). But as we see loose pages, we can see that the text is written with ink. It is here we may connect the two, as [cursed tome stand]() states: `A podium displaying an ominous tome filled with unreadable scribbles and smudged ink prints of Kat paws`, while the [Ancient Page Token](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Page#Ancient_Page) is described as: `A crumbling page torn from a long-forgotten grimoire of the Moorcroft Manor archives. The indecipherable language written upon it glows faintly in the dark as if containing power in its very words`. While it is not observed to glow in the overworld, the [promotional art](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:SpiralKnights_News_72.png) _confirms this_. It is there a fiendish glyph can be seen distinctly. On the left page of the tome there [other 3 fiendish glyphs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Furniture-Cursed_Tome_Stand.png). Notably, the glowing glyph seems to be placed into a triangle and circled by a circle, reminiscent of the _circled square_ - the symbol of philosopher's stone.

It seems to us certain, that the __power of tomes, seen as auras, is contained in the text glyphs, inscribed on the pages__.

Then there are Moorcroft Archives, to which, we believe [Tomes on the stands](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Moorcroft_Furniture#Stands) belong.

In that regard, we can look closed at the [cursed]() and [mystical tome stands](), as they give out more information in regards to the nature of Owlite texts, and by proxy, auras.

The [ancient tome stand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Tome_Stand#Ancient_Tome_Stand) may potentially belong to the kingdom of Almire, as it is the same model which is used in the final chamber of the [Inner Sanctum](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Inner_Sanctum). But, that variant is surrounded by mineral circles.

Considering the interest of Owlites with the kingdom of Almire, we believe it is plausible to move the recovered texts to the Moorcroft Archives after the events of the [Legion of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire). Otherwise, this can be simply a case of asset reuse.

##### Causes of Kataclysm

Based on the [behavior](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Furniture-Cursed_Tome_Stand-Animated.png) of [cursed tome stand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cursed_Tome_Stand#Cursed_Tome_Stand), as it creates a _cursed field around itself and summons an idle spookat_, we can parallel it to the _later summoning of Margrel through the Book of Dark Rituals_, creating a __maelstrom of curse__ with the Black Kat himself:

- It is known that some time after Margrel had recovered the The Book of Grey Feathers, the Kataclysm has happened: `... the one who opened The Book of Grey Feathers and brought about the Kataclysm` ([Black Kat Raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat_Raiment)).

    It is plausible that the Kataclysm, as we have suggested, had originated from the Academy by the action of Margrel reading through the Owlite text, mainly due to how the Academy is covered by darkness similar to the Graveyards and so different from the Scarlet Fortress. That the source of undeath and Kataclysm's effects would've been from the similar pattern, which was initiated by the Book of Dark Rituals.
- The fact that the cursed maelstrom appears due to improper application of the Book of Dark Rituals - as suggested by [Konjuring Kat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Konjuring_Kat#Dialogue) before and after fight with Margrel: `I have no idea what might happen. It could be very bad. You probably want to be prepared in case things go... awry. ... Well, that was unexpected. I'll get it right next time!`

    We can make a guess, that the release of curse in all 3 instances:

    - By Margrel, resulting in Kataclysm;
    - By Konjuring Kat, resulting in a curse maelstrom centered around the summoning site;
    - Knight's interaction with the [cursed tome stand]();

    Are all improper, or the very state of those tomes being cursed causes this reaction of curse emerging. The latter case is countered by the fact that Margrel's book is called the Book of Grey Feathers, which, paired with Spookat warnings, is indeed dangerous.

    We still have to identify the cause and effect of those tomes, their properties.
- To add a counter point to the above discovery, the fact that [mystical tome stand]() _seems to be free of curse_.

    The interaction with it is not accompanied by curse-bearing symbolism, suggesting that it is the property of cursed tomes which summons undead kat tribe to the material realm.

    It is then a question of weather the Book of Grey Feather was already cursed, or it is the unpredictability of the magic within. If we refer to [Chaos Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_Cloak) - `A forbidden mantle said to grant the wearer protection within the nameless realm where all elements are said to converge into one and divide into all`, - the chaotic theming could be considered then as a key element to this magic as vaguely defined under terms of cursed or divine, as both represent a duality of whole.

In that context we have yet to understand, how imagery of the evil eys on Kat Tribe armors related to the metaphysics of those cursed tomes. We have notes earlier, that presence of this eye is vague, given most of the armors are transmuted through alchemy. On the other hand, the nature of [Mysterious Alchemy Machine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mysterious_Alchemy_Machine) is by itself is a mystery. As far as alchemical recipes allow, the knowledge of that equipment may be external, and then, canon, preserving its original design - _with the evil eye being part of the original design_.

##### Book of Grey Feathers is The Book of Dark Rituals

Here we have to argue, weather presence of multiple [Books of Dark Rituals]() is canon to the timeline, as, to parallel Lord Vanaduke through his Seals of Almire, - in both cases their respective boss trophy material or tokens is not enough from a single defeat to transmute any of thematic equipment. _Their method of transmutation is not canon_.

We propose, that this is not diegetic to the game, as the rank mission of [Shadowplay](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay) explicitly tells of what has happened after Lord's banishment: `We all sensed the moment you defeated Vanaduke. The entire citadel shook as he fell and for a moment we thought that this realm would be destroyed along with its ruler. You must be careful wandering these halls with the place coming apart like this!` ([Nature Sprite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Overgrown_Court)).

It is important to the understanding of where precisely is the original book of Grey Feather located, as then the Book of Dark Rituals could in fact be the very Book of Grey Feathers which had Margrel read through, supposedly, at the top of the Grey Feathers tower. And, we propose, it would be _thematically conclusive for the book to be the tool to bring Margrel back_ through the Dark Ritual many years later.

To affirm this idea of Book of Dark Ritual being the Book of Grey Feather as a unique in its existence, suggests its rare drop rate, as if over the years, by accident, it had ended up among summoned Black Kats.

The fact that it is known as the book containing dark rituals, similar to the [cursed tome stand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cursed_Tome_Stand#Cursed_Tome_Stand), which was at some point an Owlite tome, yet is described as follows: `A podium displaying an ominous tome filled with unreadable scribbles and smudged ink prints of Kat paws`, this tome was in the possession of Kats, and, as it is stated that Black Kats are unable to read, it is either was used by different spookats, or was such before the Kataclysm. Even more important the possibility of _those Kats capable of reading it and writing there_.

If knight had no skill of understanding Owlite tomes, he would be likely to recreate ill-usage of the tome, which does not fit to the presence of the [mystical tome stand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mystical_Tome_Stand#Mystical_Tome_Stand) and its [behavior](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Furniture-Mystical_Tome_Stand-Animated.png). This pattern of magic, apart from Nature Sprite magic, in the context of the effect of the Dark Ritual is very similar to the white soul-like orbs drawn to the ritual site before the pink lightning strikes it.

On the other hand, there is no unique furniture in the [Moorcroft](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Moorcroft_Prize_Box) or [Guild hall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Guild_Hall_Prize_Box) prize boxes, like transmuted furniture, similar to [Lord Vanaduke's Finery]() and [unlit mask](), which on their own could not exist simultaneously as discussed in the [mask and finery section](#vanadukes-mask-and-immortality-through-curse). There, we have proposed, that _there is only one mask of Lord Vanaduke, one in his finery with the lingering presence after his soul_. Based on this we could gather, that the cursed tome is not a unique instance, but rather a multitude of books, what is the stand is not unique in its existence, there are other cursed tomes.

Due to those factors, we propose, that the Book of Grey Feathers, as it was cursed by ill-usage and potentially other factors, is the Book of Dark Rituals, as then its rarity would be symbolically explained, as one of a kind.

The cursed tomes remain, as there is both possibility of those tomes being in possession of Kats both before their banishment, and after Kataclysm - both scenarios could explain them as follows:

- The cursed tomes are tempered by spookats of the Moorcroft Archives. Most of spookats are civil enough to run Moorcroft manor, library, with an accompanied railroad.

    There are 3 fiendish sigils depicted on the left page of the cursed tomes on the stands. This means, in conjunction with the effects of interaction with the tome, that the nature of Margrel's summoning and of spookat by the cursed tome stand is fundamentally the same.

    More so, the nature of this summoning, given presence of glyphs, and glowing text of ancient pages, may link Black Kats with Dread Seal to the summoning of sealed Legion of Ur. As Legion of Ur is summoned through the sigils and ritual circles as a last resort by devilites, we can conclude that all of those 3 instances are cases of the same metaphysical laws regarding cross-dimensional transportation.

- Kat Tribe had to know of the magical properties of Owlite tomes, and, judging by animalistic behavior of Black Kats, they would have known it prior to Kataclysm and transformation to the undead.

The fact that Seraphynx in the events of [Angels from Antiquity](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angels_from_Antiquity) is found in the same chamber of an identical ritual circle as Konjuring Kat, while being located in the [Restless Railroad](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angels_from_Antiquity/Restless_Railroad), and as it is transformed only recently, we can propose, that this innate _Kat tribe property of seeking magic is a form of reincarnation of Kats through battle sprites_, and not characteristic of a select few member of the Kat Tribe: `I think these sprites are studying these old books. I didn't even know they could read!` ([Angels from Antiquity/Restless Railroad - Rhendon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angels_from_Antiquity/Restless_Railroad)).

As Spookats of Moorcroft Manor are not explicitly malevolent, the prior case of living Kat Tribe being responsible for capture of Owlite tome books seems more probable, turning them by fact of interaction to a cursed tomes.

##### Kataclysm Aftermath

Kataclysm had erased Owlites and Kat Tribe, the entire heavenly kingdom, as seen by the state Scarlet Fortress is found.

We had proposed that the Academy was at the epicenter of the Kataclysm, considering its similarity to Graveyards, which are between material realm and Underworld (`Graveyards are an unnatural place, a world between worlds where lost souls gather, hungry for the life of any live soul that must pass through. You must hurry and find the exit as fast as possible before the phantoms will awaken and stalk you!` - [Graveyard - Information Module](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Information_Module:_Graveyard)).

Based on the presence of spookats across Clockworks, and more specifically, presence of spookats across castles, we can guess a potential scope of Kat Tribe operation, with Kat Tribe invading both the Academy and Scarlet Fortress which we attribute to the heavenly kingdom, if not even its capital, in the same manner as among many citadels of Almire, we can explore only the Great Citadel at the center of Almire.

In the Lockdown mode, one of the arenas - the Fortress, - is the Scarlet Fortress, and it is filled with torn pages, similar to the occasional libraries of the Kataclysm prestige missions.

This pattern of knights visiting the most important regions of civilizations may be applied to the earlier concept of the Grey Feather Tower being the center point of the Owlite Academy. Despite the fact earlier we suggested that the tower itself remain unseen, we do not know its fate. As far as the properties of cursed maelstrom go, judging by its known behavior in consideration of Grim Gates, __Grey Feather Tower could be in a different realm altogether, as Graveyards__, as the Kataclysm did not erase Kats, but seemingly banished them into Underworld, while the rest of the Academy may be more intact, - anchored to the material realm.

##### Dark Ritual and The Nefarious Imp

We have stated earlier that the behavior of [Cursed Tome Stand](), presence of 3 fiendish sigils and summoning of Margrel [are of the same nature]().

Then we have added to this pattern the Legion of Ur, as its summoning is also achieved over [fiendish ritual circles](#summoning-from-underworld). Trojans are summoned through fiendish sigils and ritual circles while being banished, disallowing any other method of summoning.

As Margrel and other Black Kats are summoned through the dark ritual, one party or at least one metaphysic law is applied in both cases. While Konjuring Kat may have summoned Margrel by accident, _this is unknown of the other Black Kats, and is seemingly a desired outcome_: `A terrifying swarm of black kats came out of some dark portal deep within the Clockworks and have raided the Moorcroft Archives!` ([Pembrooke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke)), `Someone or something has summoned a horde of cursed black kats into the Clockworks. These shadowy beasts hunger for arcane power and raided the Moorcroft Manor Archives' precious collection of magical grimoires` ([Kataclysmic Confrontation!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/73222)).

Considering the lack of relation of Konjuring Kat to devilites, and as those parties are not seem to be interacting, we can make a guess that is is the universal law of material realm and Underworld relation itself what is seen here, but used by different parties - the summoning of banished - to Underworld, likely, - entities through the usage of ritual circles.

With this, we come to find a single inconsistency and one loose end: the dark portal from which Black Kats are summoned then could be either the one which uis similar to Pembrooke's - of a cursed maelstrom, or, as he did it by accident, a dark portal of grim gates, as that actor still remains unknown.

And yet, in both cases it is the same physical law, one we gave discussed for the first time in the [analysis of Grim Gates' portal collapse](#grim-gates-portal-collapse).

The only entity that would be interested in bringing Underworld closer to material realm would be the Nefarious Imp, which we had suspected to be one who was actually seeking for the Book of Dark Rituals, based on the word "nefarious" used in both instances: `An ancient grimoire filled with unspeakable eldritch rites. Just like any cursed tome, there is likely some twisted individual out there who wants it for extremely nefarious purposes` ([Book of Dark Rituals](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Book_of_Dark_Rituals)). There is also [Warmaster Rocket Hammer](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Warmaster_Rocket_Hammer): `Designed by Warmaster Seerus himself, this nefarious gremlin weapon is equipped with a rocket engine that can launch the wielder forward with a powerful hammer smash`, but it seems a coincidence here, rather than an intentional choice.

Black Kats are described as `These shadowy beasts hunger for arcane power and are making another attempt to execute their nefarious plans. ... It appears that illiteracy is still rampant among the black kat hordes, so they have once more taken to eating the pilfered pages rather than using them for arcane rituals` ([Kataclysmic Confrontation!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/100025)) and `It seems the hordes of black kats have eaten their fill of magical pages, and they‚Äôre disappearing back into the shadows` ([Katastrophe Box Extended!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/100025#comment-914427)). The fact Kats disappear into shadows, may be of the same nature as of _Grimalkin disappearing into shadows_ and also that they willingly disappear, rather than through banishment as Legion of Ur.

In that regard Dread Seal, the one also present on Carnavons is of greater interest. It is present on entities which seemingly remained in the material realm - Carnavons. Those also have a drawn curse symbol on their crests, blackened crests of Almire. We will return to the dread seal and its meaning later, until then we will suffice with the conclusion that dark ritual in question is the part of a connection between material realm and Underworld, a method to summon entities from the latter.

##### Warding Candles

At some point in time, [blue](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Candle_(Blue).png) and [yellow warding candles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Candle_(Yellow).png) were developed as they are widespread within the Academy.

As they ward off [Grimalkin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grimalkin), we can extrapolate this function onto general darkness referred in the [Information Module](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Information_Module:_Candlestick_Keep): `Beware the horrible Grimalkins that lurk in the dark! These cursed wraiths cannot be destroyed and the only thing they truly fear is the light of the enchanted candles. Light them with embers and take refuge in their shining embrace`. At that point in time, smaller candles were created, designed to be carried: `A personal candle for warding off the darkness, and that which lurks within it` ([Illuminating Ward](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Illuminating_Ward)).

The candles are meant to protect specifically against this threat, suggesting that the darkness was discovered before Kataclysm, or the Kataclysm wasn't as sudden as we have supposed so far.

At that, given major absence of shadow defending equipment from Owlites, we propose, that it is the latter scenario of the Academy being lowered into the Underworld, as Graveyards, while the rest of heavenly kingdom had to withstand an onslaught of undead Kat Tribe, as it is Scarlet Fortress which is populated by the undead.

Graveyards in that regard are interpreted as being haunted _already by the time of warding candles being invented_, as they are seen in a specific [Graveyard scenario room](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-Graveyard_7.png), both lit and unlit.

This creates a condition for potentially other equipment to be created after the Kataclysm in the same themes of combatting the darkness.

#### Gunslinger Priests: Part 2

As we have [previously explored](#gunslinger-priests-part-1) the possibility of Valkyries fighting Undead during the [forgotten time](#forgotten-time), we can arrived to the idea of severe lack of undead presence there, with larger focus on Isoran wardens being the foundation for the Legion of Ur. Here we also have a separate period of time, but _characterized explicitly by presence of undead_.

Thenthere was [discovered equipment and attributed to the themes of fighting undead](#fantasy-themed-undeath), within a more fantasy, Underworld-related setting. Presence of [cyclopean skull on Vanquisher's hilt](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Vanquisher) fits well with [evil eye symbolism of Chaos Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_Cloak). The description of [Cold Iron Carver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Carver), `An enchanted sword crafted from cold iron whose blade wards off the creatures of the dark` with its warding motif is also reminiscent of the [candles](#warding-candles). But, as its design and alchemy remain closely associated with Isorans, we would consider this item to belong to Isorans from the forgotten time.

Then there is [Grey Owlite Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Owlite_Shield), which is explicitly said to belong to small few Owlite wizards. Given its divine color theme, and halo, similar to one of [Divine Veil](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Veil), we can further link Valkyries and Owlites, with Philoso seemingly being present here. But, the description `Wielding it fills you with righteous vengeance` ([Grey Owlite Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Owlite_Shield)) suggests, that those feelings should've occurred after the Kataclysm, as _it creates the means for Owlites' vengeance_.

It is through shield's design similarity to [Argent Peacemaker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Argent_Peacemaker) we suspect, that gunslinger priests proper, as ones to possess sets of [Silvermail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silvermail#Alchemy_Path) and [Silversix](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silversix#Alchemy_Path) alchemy lines, are placed here, rather then to the forgotten time. Here, [Drake Scale set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Helm), as it is related to drakes, we attribute to Valkyries near the period of time when dragons and drakes had existed, [alluding to presence of undead drakes, as howlitzers, in the heavenly kingdom and Owlite keep](#howlitzers-dragons-and-drakes).

A counterpart to the elemental line of Antigua, [Gilded Griffin]( https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin) under this logic would fall to the period of time of Valkyries invading the Legion of Ur through removal of vaguely defined events, not documented across currently existing roster of items.

Lastly, there is [Troika alchemy tree](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Troika#Alchemy_Path), predominantly due to its 5-star upgrades being uncharacteristic of other items in terms of design. As most of heavy plated armor has remained in possession of 3 kingdoms, we are leaning to attribute Troika upgrades to their ancestors. As [Sudaruska](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sudaruska) contains [Volcanic Iron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Iron), it is more so likely to belong to ancestors of the Kingdom or Almire, per our discussion of [volcanic gear](#volcanic-elements).

Triglav, on the other hand, is acquired through participation in King Krogmo Coliseum, who is seemingly a devilite. Then, its recipe contains everfrost, a material used in Underworld's operations on containing souls. Those factors, we believe, make this sword to be made only through presence of Underworld, and paired with Sudaruska, it can plausible trace back to the period nearing the kingdom of Almire and forgotten time, when fisrt Isoran shadow-damage-dealing gunslingers were found on Cradle.

Given nature of [Chaos Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_cloak) and Book of Grey Feathers, those items seem us to __represent the deepest advancements of Owlites__, which, consequently, had to result in a catastrophe attributed to Kataclysm and Kat Tribe.

At that, the only event remaining before creation of the kingdom of Almire is the _banishment of Fallen Valkyrian and creation of Legion of Ur_, with Gunslinger Priests being a group closely related to Isorans, their fall as tojans, and leading to the incursion of Valkyries into the Underworld.

#### Kat Tribe Artillery

There are spookats, Black Kats, and grimalkin. As with Owlites, we can only guess the anatomy of Kats based on their alchemized armor, general context, and retellings of past events in the same manner as we understood [the plan of attack onto the Academy](#siege-of-the-academy).

Kat Tribe was capable of utilizing weaponry, including artillery (`A reclaimed raiment said to resemble the Kat Tribe hero, Preowa, whose artillery silenced the Grey Feather Tower Sages` - [Kat Eye Raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Eye_Raiment)). The definition of artillery in that regard seems to not significantly differ from real-world one, as the prior carries a capacity to siege a tower of the Academy, making it powerful enough to resemble real world counterparts.

In regards to military terms, [Howlitzers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Howlitzer), we had suggested, are inspired by howitzers, a german artillery. As Kat Tribe is permanently obscured by the Kataclysm and already is associated with shadow damage seemingly earlier, could it be, that howlitzers were the units utilized during Academy's siege as the artillery? Given that howlitzer partially behave as gremlins' [homing rockets of rocket puppies](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rocket_Puppy#Rocket_Puppy), this seems relatively plausible in the context of weaponized properties of Underworld.

As we have [proposed that howlitzer are drakes](#howlitzers-dragons-and-drakes), their existence here can only be justified by the property of spirits returning to material realm, meaning that before Kataclysm howlitzers, as drakes, had to be buried across the castle grounds of heavenly kingdom. That is, if Kataclysm is responsible for spirit returning to material realm.

In order to analyze the possibility of those scenarios, compared to our earlier suggestion of drakes invading the heavenly kingdom after dragons were defeated, we have to understand precise nature of Kat Tribe and their culture.

#### Grimalkin and Grim Convention

Regular grimalkin encountered across Candlestick Keep arrive from the darkness and vulnerable to blue warding candles. And, it is grimalkin which are referred in the candle description: `candle for warding off the darkness, and that which lurks within it` ([Illuminating Ward](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Illuminating_Ward)).

Grimalkin in real world terms is a cat. But, due to _cosmology and terminology of the setting_, we propose, that the name itself by the prefix of "grim", is meant to be associated with Underworld - grim gates, grim totems as Undercorp's or Underworld's technology, and [grim mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Mask) of Isoran folklore, - relates to the Underworld and its nature with close relation to darkness. This concept of dangerous darkness was earlier proposed as a [potential reason for Sleeper's concerns over it](#nefarious-imp).

Here, in the presence of Owlite Academy amd Grimalkin, the properties of this darkness are closely similar to one of Graveyard's, granting those entities - Phantoms and Grimalkin a state close to invincibility in the Material Realm, countered only by [warding candles](#warding-candles).

As warding candles are lit with embers, and Owlites are known to be vulnerable to fire, may suggest, the way we see it, that warding candles' powers are dependant on constant supply of embers and their innate properties. Considering Owlites' interest in Almire, and as we will discover in the [analysis of Shadow Firestorm Citadel](#true-citadel-of-almirian-empire), [heavenly kingdom surrounds the Citadel](#true-citadel-of-almirian-empire), embers could in fact be derived from there. This ties with the later presence of [Dread Seals]() on [Carnavons](), populating Shadow Firestorm Citadel, but it is a different topic, which we will discuss in detail later.

As of now, __this notion of darkness makes a strong case considering it the true or close to true reason for Sleepers need in protection__ even before we properly discuss it.

Considering presence of Grimalkin only within the Academy, in addition to Margrel, we can make a guess that those are the _Kats which were at most proximity to the epicenter of kataclysm_. In order to follow the differences between origins of Black Kats, grimalkin and the rest of spookats, - as a metaphysical change had to occur to them during the Kataclysm.

##### Maskeraith

In the context of Grimalkin and here covered [phantoms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Phantom), we have to discuss [Maskeriath battle sprite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith).

Maskeraiths are similar to grimalkin and Black Kats in general by the fact of being ghost-like dark-colored apparitions, and morphology, similar to wraiths. The latter is important, since _grimalkin are ones to be classified as wraiths_: `These cursed wraiths cannot be destroyed and the only thing they truly fear is the light of the enchanted candles` ([Information module - Candlestick Keep](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Candlestick_Keep#Lore)). Apart from the naming convention, spookats and grimalkin resemble undead Kat Tribe, contrasting seemingly corporeal [Seraphynx](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphynx). In that regard, Maskeraiths are referred by Rhedon as phantoms: `Yikes, are those the sprites or some kind of phantom? ... but there's a ghost over your shoulder! Let's hope these sprites haven't invested all their power into good looks. Use that one to clear the path ahead so a rescue team can get through safely!` ([The Phantom Mask - Creeping Cavern - Rhedon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Phantom_Mask/Creeping_Cavern)).

If _Seraphynx represents Kat Tribe before the Kataclysm_ and _Drakon of ancient dragons_, where does Maskeriath fit, or rather, __whom Maskeriath is meant to embody?__

Here we have to look at the contents of [Spritely Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spritely_Prize_Box), within which all of the rest battle sprite reskins are found. In case of Maskeriath there are 3 reskins, apart from the Grey Prize Box, which will be very important later: [Volcanic](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith_(Volcanic)), [Freeze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith_(Freeze)), and [Snarblepup](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith_(Snarblepup)).

Phantoms and Grimalkin are similar due to being a permanent danger within Underworld darkness or proximity to it. Moreover, it is Margrel, who is transformed to grimalkin, has the same curse properties of a [phantom](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Phantom), including the bright pink color of curse.

Phantoms have a skull with a whirling soul inside it. There are a few other instances of this design - [Estavio](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Estavio) and [Hector](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hector) residing in Moorcroft manor. As we have earlier attributed this property of _souls' capacity both to linger and remain bound to its bones or item_, discussed earlier in the [context of Lord Vanaduke's passing](#vanadukes-mask-and-immortality-through-curse), here, Maskeraith is seemingly related to the mask, as the latter is explicitly brought up _multiple times_.

Maskeraith's mask is focused upon by [Rhedon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Phantom_Mask/Creeping_Cavern): `
I'm curious... what do you think is behind their masks? Wait, no, I don't want to know` ([The Phantom Mask - Creeping Cavern - Rhedon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Phantom_Mask/Creeping_Cavern)), even being referred in mission's name: [The Phantom Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Phantom_Mask). The mask is also present in Maskeraith skills, specifically, [Shadow Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadow_Cloak_(Battle_Sprite_Ability)). It can be speculated, that mask's symbolism is related to the ability itself to remain unnoticed, but we would like to look into metaphysical aspects of the mask.

Maskeraith in its [frost](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith_(Freeze)) and [volcanic](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith_(Volcanic)) reskins acquires properties of [hail](#influences-of-underworld) and [fire deities](#blackened-shrine-and-magma-deity), as unnatural freeze and volcanic motif are two elements, apart from presence of [Vile deity](#fiendish-cults), which persist across much of equipment with those themes.

Lastly, [Snarblepup](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith_(Snarblepup)) is less direct in its conception. But, one property of Snarbolax, which could link the two is the attunement of the latter to [shadows and haunting](#snarbolax-and-haunting-through-curse). The ghostly, non-corporeal nature of the two as seemingly influenced by Underworld, inks the two.

Even more so, _so far we have considered entities capable of inflicting curse as ones of most powerful on Cradle_, Maskeraith, under certain conditions, __also possesses an ability to inflict curse__ over [Chaotic Haze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaotic_Haze#Chaotic_Haze). The very naming convention of `chaotic` and link to all status effects seems to trace back to the [Chaos Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_cloak).

Maskeriath does not have capacity to deal elemental damage with the crystal harness, but it has piercing, golden harness available. We [have discussed how piercing damage and gold are paired in their divinity](#divinity-and-alchemical-gold), as of metal and an applications of this damage type, and how [crystal and elemental damage are paired though known metaphysics of souls within crystal](#minerals-and-souls-part-2-mineral-charge), now with addition of the relation to the Nameless Realm and its relation to elements.

The dark harness is called simply as that, dark, so not much information could be extracted from it. On the other hand, considering how shadow damage is unnatural to the material realm, its creation could be as vague as the nature of the shadow damage itself, being defined by Spiral Order biotechs only in such vague terms, meaning that the material of the harness is unknown to the point of being created from Underworld materials.

We can make a guess, based on many shadow damage type weapons and equipment, that [shadow steel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadow_Steel) _has a chance of being used here_, mainly due to presence of other metals, such as gold and iron, omitting elemental crystal harness, while allowing for effective combat when equipped.

Considering effects of dark matter, its relation to shadow damage, the very fact, dark matter is used to feed the battle sprite, makes it a very unique in its own regard entity, on par with called here reincarnation of past species - such as Kats and Dragons, - through their according battle sprites.

As we further attempt to identify entities behind Maskeraith, we will attempt to find peculiarities in sprite's evolution similar to an aforementioned [Chaotic Haze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaotic_Haze#Chaotic_Haze):

- Tier 2 Maskeraith has a single centered horn, which remind of the [Grim Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Mask).
- The ghastly mask, attained by [Haunted Haze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Haunted_Haze#Haunted_Haze) ultimate ability has asymmetrical eyes. This asymmetric design is reminiscent of strangers.
- The entity behind Maskeraith design may be one depicted in the designs of the 5 star variants of the [Shade Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shade_Helm) which on its own refers to a concept of shade, as well as having similar head and eye shape, _reminiscent of a beak_, apart from cultural inspirations.

    More so, the larger alchemy tree of [Sentinel Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sentinel_Helm) has designs, fitting for those to wield [Cold Iron Vanquisher](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Vanquisher), as alchemy here [transcends modern designs](#technology-alchemy-and-Isoran-redesigns), alluding to Isoran [past during vague position of forgotten time](#gunslinger-priests-part-1).
- The [Shadow Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadow_Cloak_(Battle_Sprite_Ability)) ability is only one depicting sprite's mask, with one eye lit within the part of the mask in the dark, with the other being in the light.

    It makes us think of the anatomical significance of the mask, with the previously established context of mask relating to the soul, which may also point to the nature of Maskeraith as a soul bound to a battle sprite.
- The [Vengeful Quills](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vengeful_Quills#Vengeful_Quills) ultimate ability's design is shown as a _quill similar in color and texture to luminite_. This may be related to the general theme of Owlites and attributed to them and valkyries vengefulness (`A resplendent replica of the shield thought to have been issued to the most eminent of Owlite wizards. Wielding it fills you with righteous vengeance` - [Grey Owlite Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Owlite_Shield)). Paired with potentially avian design, could Maskeraith through unknown means relate to Owlites or greater heavenly kingdom?
- The [Virulent Quills](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Virulent_Quills#Virulent_Quills) ultimate makes the quills seems as made of valestone with more pronounces green hue of the [vile fiend set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiend_Mail). The [Caustic Quills](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Caustic_Quills) are seemingly of dark matter. This property ties with close relation of poison to Underworld. But, on the other hand, this theme could be attributed not to Vile deity, but hazardous nature of extreme frost and poison.
- The [Haunted Haze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Haunted_Haze#Haunted_Haze) ultimate seemingly _weaponizes souls in the similar manner as Margrel's homing spiked orbs_, as projectiles. Given that defeated enemies release those orbs, makes us think of a common, soul-based, underlying nature of those.
- The [Chaotic Haze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaotic_Haze#Chaotic_Haze) ultimate, apart from earlier connection to the nature of chaos, is similar to the [Sealed Sword](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sealed_Sword) status inflictions. And, as the sword is devoid of curse, it may be attributed to it being sealed by paper seals.

    During the _initiation of the haze, ghosts are seen to swirl_, which are likely the effect of the hex  - [Hexing Haze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hexing_Haze), - being applied.

    This property, we suggest, can be related to the nature of the law, __which had brought spirits to material realm planetary scale in the first place__.

#### Evo Catalysts and The Core

In the context of battle sprite's ultimates, to fully manifest them, [catalysts](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ultimate_Evo_Catalyst#Evo_Catalyst) are used.

By the design of those items, it seems they belong to high-tech designs nearing ones of rectangular plates of Core's shell and underlying Whitespace.

While we haven't yet delved into the nature of Whitespace, one element of those designs seems evident - those catalysts open up larger possibilities for evolution, allowing battle sprites to distance themselves from explicitly artificial nature to one embodied by the transformation.

As it was said, battle sprites have erratic energy signatures: `The energy signature I'm detecting is erratic, but still definitely a battle sprite` ([A Revelation in Flames - Sunset Steppes - Rhedon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Revelation_in_Flames/Sunset_Steppes)). We propose, that catalysts contain the same transformative effect as the initial transformation through introduction to Cradle, causing deviation from the standard E-class.

And, as those events are happening on Cradle, with presence of the Core and its energy (`Tier 3 is closest to the Core and much like how high level items respond to its power, so do monsters.
Many of them take on new forms and are considered at their most dangerous. You must prepare before taking on each mission` - [Best of the Beast - Hahn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Best_of_the_Beast)), we believe, __Catalysts contain the same transformative through application of energy effect, as the the Core__ and its effects onto Cradle by parallels in the design and motif.

As they contain far greater amounts of energy, while being contained within distinct mechanism in design of the _plated structure_, as the Core, the principles, used to contain this energy are __identical to ones applied at the Core__.

#### Battle Sprites Transformation Conclusion

With all of those factors considered, we propose, that Maskeraith represents and entity, or several entities, if judged by the masks' shapes, which inhabit the Underworld.

Through this _artificial unity or even overtake of Underworld's curse-aligned powers over a battle sprite_, this creates conditions for a phenomenon, observed so far, as the state of being afflicted by generalized curse with powers granted from this state.

This condition, we believe, is closely related to the nature of [soul being bound to an object](#vanadukes-mask-and-immortality-through-curse), or [haunting](#haunting) -  entering a category of entities, such as, predominantly, Lord Vanaduke's Mask and, in lesser manner, Phantoms, whose powers are derived from being affected by the curse in a non-detrimental manner, while being tethered to a corporeal object.

Due to the aforementioned, _unprecedentedly large,_ set of Maskeraith's skills and abilities, as well as _a potential of manipulating souls over Hexing Haze ultimate_, creation of such entity from an artificial battle sprite seems as another instance of 2 properties merging:

- An unseen power, responsible for manifestation of past civilizations in Seraphynx and Drakon, has applied in the same pattern powers from the Underworld.
- Properties or powers from Underworld are manipulate by an aforementioned power, suggesting its omnipotence in relation to reachable realms.

So far we have the following conclusions regarding this power:

- This power is emitted from Cradle, influencing classified as [E-class](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Dialogue-E-Class_Battle_Sprite.png) battle sprites. They are transformed, further evolving through Evo Catalysts, containing the same energy used to initially transform them. The _Catalysts' designs further link this type of energy with the Whitespace of the Core._
- This energy, when applied, is capable of transforming artificial entities into near-living beings, while preserving their internal structure, so they are identified as Isoran battle sprites by Isoran technology.
- Transformations, induced by this energy, manifest as species with the states of those from the past - Kats of Kat Tribe, both natural and cursed - the latter being Black Kats; dragons of 3 elements; and fiends. _Each sprite embodies the totality of those species_, the families of those species and states they were found in some points in time, and their innate abilities, attributed to those states.
- Those abilities surpass original properties of battle sprites, granting powers, which are naturally intended to be wielded by embodies species as part of their existence. Even if the latter is absent - such as families of Kats or extinct dragons, - those are still remembered within evolutionary branches of the specific battle sprite.

This is a novel theme - of _alchemical replication_, - alchemical in a sense, that it surpasses causality, apart from originating from the past, - __being the effect of the energy, emitted by the Core__.

#### Black Kats and Curse

We will study Black Kats from multiple perspectives: their design, presence on Cradle, - prestige missions, background information on Owlites, and derived knowledge about metaphysics of curse up until this point of the analysis.

Some units of the Kat Tribe seem to be sealed somewhere, most likely Underworld: `Someone or something has summoned a horde of cursed Black Kats into the Clockworks. These shadowy beasts hunger for arcane power and raided the Moorcroft Manor Archives' precious collection of magical grimoires. In the wrong hands these ancient tomes could be catastrophic, but it turns out that Black Kats can't read, so they instead decided to just eat them. The residents of Moorcroft Manor would like you to retrieve the Ancient Pages of the magical grimoires that quite likely reside in the stomachs of Black Kats. We'll leave you to figure out just how to recover them` ([Kataclysmic Confrontation](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/73222)).

Black Kats are explicitly said to be summoned. We concluded on the idea, that it is the same mechanism, which allowed for trojans to be summoned. While their role as ones surviving in undeath past the Kataclysm, someone had to summon them initially at the start o the event.

Grimalkin inhabit places closest to the Underworld, such as Owlite Academy stuck in the same state as Graveyards, between dimensions: `Graveyards are an unnatural place, a world between worlds where lost souls gather, hungry for the life of any live soul that must pass through`. Grimalkin are similar to Phantoms as they can be stopped only temporality.

- All Black Kats and Margrel possess power to inflict curse.
- Summoning of Margrel introduces a giant maelstrom enveloping entirety of the Moorcroft manor, the same as one seen across malfunctioned grim gates but magnitudes larger.

Through these characteristics a nature of Kataclysm could be narrowed - one of opening a portal into the Underworld, whose influence poured into the material realm, effects the closest of living entities within its reach. Based on earlier quote it seems that Black Kats are different from the rest of Kat Tribe by being bearers of curse. By the time they are summoned, they are already cursed, instead of becoming such through consumption of magical grimoires. This could be a potential precedent for them being explicitly sealed, as trojans, after the Kataclysm. Presence of a [Dread Seal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Seal), which is also placed on Carnavons, suggests that whatever function the seal serves, _it is applicable to both Carnavons and Black Kats, in the end relating to curse_. Moreover, it is seen on [Faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Faust) itself which should be kept in mind - both the design and color scheme.

This concept of sealing in the Underworld by a faction represented by Valkyries can be also affirmed by a following idea - if trojans were sealed by heavenly kingdom, as the Fallen was banished into the Underworld, the ability to seal Black Kats and to, potentially, summon them back is one likely attributed to those who already used it - Owlites of heavenly kingdom. This would also explain the time when warding candles were invented, as no other darkness, apart from graveyard's, wherein candles were seen, was present at that time - an idea, [linked earlier to the forgotten time of gunslinger priests](#gunslinger-priests-part-2).

Presence of Void Souls inside the Core seems as the strong argument in favour a proposal of the Core, rather that the Kataclysm, being responsible for the local changes in Cradle's metaphysics. In that regard, Core could accelerate the notions already present, in the form of haunted passages, for example, as well as cause seemingly unpredictable behavior, such as transformation of battle sprites, _given general notion of the Core amplifying preexisting traits through energy_. In particular, a transcendence to different types of damage, lacking of normal damage is confirmed by [Hahn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hahn): `You have a strange definition of recreation if that's the case. Tier 3 fiends and undead are nothing to sneeze at, in fact they're among the worst creatures you'll find so close to the Core. Devilite management seems to be the worst at these depths and that results in some very violent devilites. ... Exactly, and they're worse now. And the same goes for the undead. You'll find that howlitzers become particularly bothersome with their enhanced firing and homing capabilities. Lastly, prepare for fiend and undead monsters to potentially deal pure shadow damage` ([Darkest Forces - Hahn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Darkest_Forces)).

Considering this, we can place period when Philoso made most of his advancement into the very end of Owlite civilization, as then presence of undead would be justified, invention of devices against Underworld's darkness, and most of end-game high-performance equipment, such as Chaos Cloak. Gunslinger priests would be then placed in that same period of time.

##### Margrel and <span class="through-curse">Immortality Through Curse</span>

As for the Kat Tribe potential knowledge on curse, the fact their alchemized armor is one bearing evil eye symbolism - we can look at a different example of an alchemized equipment from an extinct civilization:

- Almirian Crusader armor is completely restored only by traversing Shadow Lairs.
- Ancient Plate armor which we had attributed to titans - tortomega, - has a unique health boost, an `unusual health bonus` both in function and in description of the perk.
- Owlite robes, specifically [Chaos Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_Cloak), despite Owlite being erased from existence, has antique evil eye design on its garb.
- Valkyrian armors connected to resistance to curse.
- `A clawed costume made by Moorcroft tailors. It's perfect for curious knights who are prone to pause for naps after a long night of adventuring` ([Kat Suits](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Savage_Kat_Suit)) possesses evil eye designs on the shoulder pads, fitting with the rest of Kat Tribe associated armors.

Based on those instances, it seems that Spiral Order had not performed much modifications to the original designs. We can propose that Kat Tribe had already known of the curse before the Kataclysm. This is also coincidentally fits with Kat Tribe's magic being characterized so far as evil: `A whisker won from the great Kat Tribe hero, Margrel. They were traditionally worn as a ward against Owlite magics but now represent the triumph of goodly magical arts over evil` ([Wicked Whisker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wicked_Whisker)). As the name suggests, wicked, it possesses properties, more likely to be attributed to the entire theme of curse and Underworld.

##### Dark Ritual, Pink Lightning: Part 1

The last element if the pink lightning striking Margrel's ritual site when it is summoned. We suggest, so far, a vague idea of it being a sign of Underworld's presence, as across myth's lightning strike was associated with the presence of the supernatural, or more commonly, divine presence or intervention.

In case of the dark ritual, it is not the divine presence, but of Underworld. We have to consider similar lightning in case of Arkus, formation of minerals, we can suggest that it was the tapping into the Underworld's more distinct energy, one of the same nature as the one to cause minerals to form.

The real reasoning for specifically Arkus's behavior here is vague, but we can lean into the idea of trojans inflicting shock, as they possess inner charge, which can be weaponized. And, as in both instances there are lightning arcs stemming from the dark matter crystal as a sign of Underworld's influence, we believe it to be linked to this condition.

This does not constitute that the crystal was embedded, as we have already covered the case of dark matter. But rather it serves as the conduit for the connection with the Underworld.

As for Sparks of Life - as those are already discrete quantities of energy, enough to revive, presence of lightning could seem as a design choice. And yet, it is accompanied by falling dust, similar to the presence of the Swarm. This seems as a different instance of signaling energy's presence through blue lightning, its excess, symbolized by the temporary attack buff.

When Margrel is summoned, bright soul orbs are seem to be attracted to the ritual site with a distinct red-pink swirl forming, characteristic of the collapsed grim gate's portal. Then the portal overtakes the entirety of the depth, and soul-like projectiles are now spiked orbs.

As Black Kats are said to be explicitly summoned, and during Margrel's fight they appear in large amounts, this seems to us, as if the portal in the grim gates and gateway for Black Kats to cross into material realm are physically identical.

#### Dread Seal: Part 1

Presence of Dread Seals both on Black Kats, Margrel, and Carnavons also seems as if it was placed by somebody, - an idea we mentioned several times. There, based on the design and naming convention of a seal, __we have assumed that the Seal is devised by Valkyries or Owlites__, as it is means to contain or seal the curse. If wwe looked onto the design itself, __Seal's design is similar to the Fu talisman, as it is placed by priest on ghost's forehead in order to hinder or disarm it.__

This concept is also reminiscent of the [Sealed Sword](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sealed_Sword), which we proposed to be the retrieved and sealed variant of Gran Faust, as it possesses in all of alchemy paths evil eye symbolism, suggesting that the symbol was recontextualized in the Avenger line of upgrades.

The state of this sword, as a sealed one, we considered the reason for its lack of ability to inflict curse, compared to, for example, [Chaotic Haze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaotic_Haze#Chaotic_Haze) of Maskeraith, as it is not restricted by the seals, but latter's nature and powers are drawn from the Underworld.

Based on this we have to assume, that the party which had placed the Dread Seals onto Carnavons and Black Kats are Owlites and, potentially, Valkyries of heavenly kingdom. Specifically, _given presence of priests in both contexts, gunslinger priests seems to be the one faction most plausibly responsable for placement of the seals onto the undead._

On the contrary, there is only speculated existence of a war between the undead Almirian Empire and heavenly kingdom. Paired with the presence of a seal on Carnavons, this would be a fitting explanation. But so far we lack any further evidence.

From this, 3 further interpretations of the timeline emerge:

- Dread Seals belongs to Owlites. Carnavons had to appear later into the timeline, but still in the past  - before emergence of Kat Tribe, - as they would be once to encounter Owlites in order for Dread Seals to be placed.
- Dread Seals belongs to Owlites. Margrel and the rest of Black Kats at some point in time had to be marked with the seal, either after the Kataclysm or in the Underworld, from where they are summoned. Given lack of devilite presence in that regard, we can only assume that the annual summoning of Black Kats was a later development after the fall of Owlites. This proposal assumes a war between heavenly kingdom and undead Almirian Empire, given presence of undead in the academy.
- The Dread Seal specifically, not its golden variant present on the Avenger, is Underworld's invention. We propose such scenario due to purple color, uncharacteristic of Owlite technology and magic, presence of curse-colored seal on Faust, which is more likely to belong to the Underworld, and fue to trojans lacking the seal, but they are once known to be explicitly sealed by heavenly kingdom. There is a possibility of Dread Seal being a later invention, but _this would contradict with a more common presence of Black Kats, as they are seemingly more easy to be summoned, compared to trojans._ It is due to seals design and assumed function, we came to an idea of Black Kats being sealed.

Prior 2 instances create a requirement for a period of time, when Owlites had to persist for some time after the initial Kataclysm. Even if Carnavons would be marked with the seal before the Kataclysm, Kat Tribe remains.

_Given presence of evil eye symbolism on the Chaos Cloak,_ as well as its resistances, we assume, that it would be the reason for a major advancement in understanding of curse and general cosmology by Owlites.

We could've attributed Dread Seal to Underworld, which would seem more fitting, as the seal is purple, rather than yellow or gold, as in the Avenger, but given Chaos Cloak, we encounter a case of a, seemingly, cultural shift at least in the designs. Due to this less distinctive property, we have to come back to the intention of the Dread Seal after we cover the [Shadow Firestorm Citadel]().

#### Inversion of Curse

It is here a concept of inverted curse should be brought up. Golden evil eye present on the [Divine Avenger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Avenger) is of heavenly kingdom, or more specifically, of Owlite research.

Compared to the Dread Seal of purple color, golden variation of the seal belongs to heavenly kingdom most likely. If we consider the idea of Faust and Dread Seal being of Underworld, it would thematically be fitting for golden seal be at least an inversion of the prior state, being placed within a completely weaponized against Underworld sword, derived of Gran Faust. __This thematic approach would constitute, that the seal would be inverted, too, from Underworld's Dread Seal to a supposed golden seal of heavenly kingdom.__

The Avenger and Faust both possess curse symbolism, a shape encompassing the evil eye is one of [Dread Seal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Seal). In case of Avenger, color is inverted to gold. But it belong to an age when Valkyries invaded Underworld, as it would require valkyries to encounter it properly to gain such deep understanding of curse and its symbol, in order to wield it.

The [Divine Veil](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Veil) has [Silverweave](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silverweave) woven in it. Silverweave is described as: `A length of understated cloth intricately interwoven with precious metal. its tastefully ostentatious, yet prudently protective` ([Silverweave](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silverweave)). Considering its usage in alchemy, we can make a guess that the precious metal in question is [Sun Silver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_silver). Sun Silver is used in [Divine Avenger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Avenger) as well as [Miracloth](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Miracloth).

Miracloth is relevant to the [Miracle armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Miracle_Cloak):

- `A miraculous mask said to grant a single miracle to the wearer when they need it most. In practice, it'll likely save your skin more often than that` ([Miracle Hood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Miracle_Hood)).
- `A miraculous mantle said to grant a single miracle to the wearer when they need it most` ([Miracle Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Miracle_Cloak)).

All of the alchemy branch has an elemental motif: _magic, elemental, miracle, and chaos, accompanied by the divine_. All of those characteristics, we suggest, __relate to the nature of Nameless Realm, as one containing within itself also curse__, as seen by other instances of chaotic motif. We have to keep this concept in mind, but currently, it reminds us most of the one other concept - an alchemical Prime Matter, originated from the round chaos of the void, from which world proper was created. [We will analyze this motif in greater detail as we approach themes of Mercury in the analysis of gremlin technology]().

While the Void will be discussed later, of course, it is the very one mentioned in the very beginning in relation to the Swarm, Nameless Realm is what is in the focus of this discussion. We have to keep nature of Nameless Realm as a potential alchemical candidate for the originating place of all matter, but we still do not know anything in regards to the in-universe Void. So this is the concept we must keep in mind.

#### Moorcroft Manor, Retchwell Manor

Remaining spookats, the undead Kat Tribe, has established the Moorcroft Manor within one of Owlite castles, where they move rest of recovered artifacts, including the [Book of Grey Feathers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cursed_Tome_Stand#Cursed_Tome_Stand) defiled by Margrel as well as other tomes: [Tome of Rage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tome_of_Rage) and [Mythical Tome](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mystical_Tome_Stand#Mystical_Tome_Stand): `A podium displaying a magical tome filled with arcane symbols, esoteric formulae, and (a) few particularly rude doodles`.

_This makes it seem, as if the Manor is one of the remaining distinctly conscious faction of Kat species after the Kataclysm._ Even more so, the existence of the [Restless Railroad](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angels_from_Antiquity/Restless_Railroad) suggests, that there are potentially other locations, which withstood in undeath the events of Kataclysm, unrelated to the Undercorp specifically.

Apart from Moorcroft Manor there exist other manors, populated by more hostile spookats - such is the [Retchwell Manor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scared_to_Death#Gate_Map) and its [Iron Courtyards](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scared_to_Death#Gate_Map). Given the design choice of the mission to contain rotating elemental variants of the manor, we can suspect the manor itself being much larger compared to the Moorcroft Manor even with the Restless Railroad included.

As far as Kataclysm allows to look into Owlites' past, we do not have information, weather culture of manors was present in the past, it was a post-Kataclysmic culture shift among undead Kat Tribe. The Retchwell Manor is implicitly referred as an `Owlite castle[s]` in its mission: `The ruins of Owlite castles are dark and cursed places that are swarming with legions of undead spookats. The worst of these, the seemingly invincible grimalkins, constantly lurk in the shadows, awaiting the moment your life-saving light is finally snugged out. Some knights succumb to the darkness and become paralyzed with fear in these shadowy realms. The only thing that can save them are brave knights who have long lost their childhood fears of the dark and all the terrible creatures that lurk within ... Save the lost Knight from joining the ranks of the dead in the haunted manor` ([Scared to Death](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scared_to_Death)). But as it is stated to be haunted, could there be a time, when it was a regular castle-like manor?

While Tome stands were covered, Tome of Rage is of particular interest to us due to a symbol of alchemy in its cover. Is symbol of alchemy also universal? As alchemy is used by Spiral Order for many years, and as energy seems to be universal, the symbol of alchemy is present across many locations, mainly in the form of alchemy station, including one in the Sanctuary - most remote location of all known to date, apart from the Apocrean Realm bleeding onto material realm, but also, alchemy orbs. Considering nature of the latter as catalysts for the transmutation itself, it is the philosopher's stone - the results of the Great Work, allowing for any matter to be transmuted into different matter. So far, __Alchemy Orbs seem to be universal, emerging mechanism from utilizing alchemy, same as the symbol of a spiral or energy__.

The Moorcroft Manor became the main hub for less hostile of spookats. There, a ritual site was established and taken hold of by [Konjuring Kat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Konjuring_Kat) for banished grimalkin to be summoned, utilizing same fiendish sigils made from Moonstone, with several attempts by far resulting in [Kataclysmic Confrontation](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kataclysmic_Confrontation), but with the presence of the tomes from Owlite libraries, - as much of ancient texts and levels connects back to Owlite academy, a different approach could be taken: of summoning banished to the Underworld Kat Tribe kats through powers of Nameless Realm, studied by Owlites. To be precise, _a law, utilized by Grim Gates to bridge Underworld and material realm, is applied to summon Black Kats._

Ritual site, when activated, has similar effects of trailing light orbs as the [Mystical Tome Stand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Moorcroft_Furniture#Animations). Although Margrel summoning site is not made of dark matter, sigils themselves and same curse-colored maelstrom before Margrel is summoned, bearing similarity to closing portals of Grim Gates.

##### Nefarious Imp and Margrel, and Kataclysm

The entire plot of Margrel, as well as of Nefarious Imp relation to it must still be kept in mind. Margrel is summoned by accident, but he himself is capable of summoning Black Kats as the unknown party. The Konjuring kat does not seem as the nefarious entity referred by the [Book of Dark Rituals](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Book_of_Dark_Rituals): `Just like any cursed tome, there is likely some twisted individual out there who wants it for extremely nefarious purposes`, which adds a point to devilites, Undercorp even, being those actors, if not the Imp himself behind the Black Kat plot. Someone had to place this dread seal in the same manner as elemental Lumbers possess it.

If we would develop ths idea further, we would suggest, that Nefarious Imp is behind the formation of Kat Tribe  in the first place, as the latter supposedly has incorporated antique evil eye designs into its armors. While the antique design comes from either titans or graviton bomb, under current theory it had to be derived from the general simplified symbol of the evil eye tracing back to Greavers.

Then, the idea of sleeper cell within Owlite civilization would imply a planning rooted in a conflict of interests targeted at Owlites and greater heavenly kingdom.

Despite the distinct lack of presence of Undercorp, brought up here as a perpetrator for the summoning of Black Kats, it seems to us to be a part of a narrative, where Cradle, or material realm in general, is sieged throughout the years by Underworld. This proposal, compared to supposedly postmodern interpretation of many unconnected one-off stories being discovered over Cradle, connected from the start under a theme of Underworld's involvement.

#### Seraphynx and Divine Kats

As Drakon became reincarnation of dragons, so Seraphynxs became reincarnations of Black Kats of Kat Tribe before their banishment. This process has resulted in resemblance of Kat Tribe with heavenly powers of valkyries. And yet, identities of Kat Tribe resurface as these sprites are yet again drawn to Owlite tomes: `I think these sprites are studying these old books. I didn't even know they could read!` ([Angels from Antiquity/Restless Railroad - Rhendon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angels_from_Antiquity/Restless_Railroad)), specifically in a location looking particularly the same as the one in the Moorcroft Manor inhabited by the [Konjuring Kat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Konjuring_Kat).

- [Katastrophe Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Katastrophe_Returns_Prize_Box) has both banished Kat Tribe accessories and Valkyries', except for regular themed items.
- [Seraphynx (Black Kat)](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphynx_(Black_Kat)) has all the signs of banished Kat Tribe, plus characteristics of Owlite anatomy, specifically [Prismatic Seraph'tenna](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Prismatic_Seraph%27tenna), and equipment of valkyrie armor: [Prismatic Dazzling Gem](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Prismatic_Dazzling_Gem), [Prismatic Heavenly Halo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Prismatic_Heavenly_Halo), and prismatic wings ([Wings](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wings)).

Through [Seraphynx](#seraphynx) it is more or less known how kats have looked originally, moreover having divine attributes to them, which fits with prior idea of sleeper cell of Kat tribe in, seemingly, academy and greater heavenly kingdom, embodying this period of time. As far as that time period allows, the origins of civilization of Kats remain unknown.

This design contradicts the idea of Kat Tribe possessing curse-themed armor, unless, we pose them as outliers. This idea is based on the fact of sleeper cell existing within Owlite civilization, as kats, serving kat Tribe: `An impressive mail instilled with the might of Kat Nappers, the undercover sleeper cell of the Kat Tribe` ([Black Kat Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat_Mail)).

In this interpretation, Kats seem to possess divine attributes, with the Kat Tribe, led by Margrel, to be outliers. It is then the unknown reason for Margrel's plot to capture the Book of Grey Feathers. If we would attempt to draw parallels with other curse-ridden entities, - Lord Vanaduke, trojans, Fallen Valkyrian, titans even, - they all have fallen to Underworld's influence due to compromised means. In case of the Book of Grey Feather, the only 2 items which would imply its contents are the [Divine Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Mantle) and [Chaos Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_Cloak), as both relate to __fundamental, curse incorporated, chaotic properties of reality__.

#### The Moon, Nature Sprites, and Immortality

Lastly, due to connection of seemingly nature-themed magic and Nameless Realm, here we suggest a potential inspiration behind Nature Sprites.

We have previously discussed their anatomy as closely related to nature, both being fur-coated nature-themed civilization and their nature-themed spiral designs of magic [seen in the Firestorm Citadel](#almire-and-spirit-mother).

The idea of those creatures in the context of heavenly, or rather Celestial Kingdom, reminds us of the moon rabbits, or Jade Rabbits. They are relevant in the Chinese myth of Hou Yi and Moon Goddess Chang'e.

According to the myths, originally, 9 Suns were present in the sky, rising one after another, but one day they appeared all together, scorching the earth, causing a cataclysm. An archer, Hou Yi, shot down 8 of 9 Suns, allowing only for a single Sun to rise, and as a reward, gods granted Hou Yi elixir of immortality, which he shared with his wife, Chang'e.

Recounts of the myth here do differ, as Chang'e is said to have stollen the elixir, as well as her intentions. Chang'e was not supposed to drink elixir of immortality, and due to this she was banished to the moon. In other retelling of the myth, Chang'e had to depart to the Moon, as immortals could not exist on Earth.

Moon Rabbits are related to Chang'e, being associated with Chang'e, as well as take part in the creation of the elixir of immortality on the Moon. Across myths their are depicted as benevolent or mischievous creatures.

This legend is an example of immortality's presence across many different cultures, starting from western alchemy and enveloping eastern beliefs, around which the later concept of alchemy was also built. Due to depiction of the spiral on the Moon's near side, there can be a symbolic meaning for it. But, as Chang'e seemingly differs in her intentions compared to Spirit Mother, this may be only a similarity, rather than a direct inspiration. Although presence of the moon might be relevant in this context, as it can serve as a candidate for the heavenly kingdom, potentially less related to the castles of Clockworks, or even preceding them, as there is an established divinity of celestial beings. It is on the Moon, according to the myth, Hou Yi constructs a palace for his wife.

Due to how celestial beings - as valkyries, - are positioned in the opposition to Underworld through the [Fallen Valkyrian](#fallen-valkyrian), and other equipment, his fall already involves crossing at least into Underworld - that being 2 realms. So, a dimensional aspect is present, according to the general cosmology, rather than being confined to material realm, there are 3 realms to include.

And, if we take other religious motifs, this heavenly kingdom, albeit through metaphors, could have been located in a different realm, rather than directly above 3 mountains above Almire, as [discussed earlier](#celestial-kingdom). It would be then still plausible for this heavenly kingdom not to intervene with the Almire's Fall, as they would be located in, supposedly Nameless Realm.

But, this proposal conflicts with the idea of Nameless Realm being forbidden, so there must be a reason for it. We can suggest, that modern Owlites discovered the Nameless Realm proper, from which the knowledge of sealing magic would be discovered, and, it follows curse symbolism.

Apart from our so far vague motif of cursed immortality, the idea of a secret to immortality residing on the Moon, seems here, if extrapolated onto Spiral Knights multi-dimensional alchemical cosmology, seems as if the Nameless Realm, as prime matter, would be the soul-powered source of immortality, granted by entities residing there.

This seems to us as a reason for Whitespace and Nameless Realm existence theme-wise, as there are no sources pointing at their origins, as well as the process of Core's construction.

If heavenly kingdom was both a supernatural and material location, its deeper regions would eventually transition into a different realm, similar to how reality of Cradle was falling into Apocrean Realm within the [Shroud of Apocrea](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea_(Mission)). This also fittingly ties with the naming convention both of valkyries, as divine guardians, and as celestials, who did come as [auras and souls](#auras-and-souls) from the higher realm to [corporeal bodies](#corporeal-body), closely connected to the source of souls - our to-be-proposed Nameless Realm, but not directly within it, allowing for a safe transitional state.

If we attempt to develop this idea further, we would arrive to a mirrored position to curse. As curse - alien for material realm, while granting immortality by tethering soul to material realm, or serving as a method of damnation of physical body with soul tied to it, - would the state of divinity, coming from Spirit Mother, paradise of heavenly kingdom, or the Nameless Realm, cause the same effect of immortality, but in opposite to Underworld's influence?

### Intermission: Analysis of Curse

Before we move on to the analysis of Gremlin Empire, specifically nature of the complex network of connections between the Core, Whitespace, and the Swarm, with an addition of Sleeper, Architect, and the Void, we are required to cover everything we now know of the phenomenon of Curse up until this point with the fullest context of corresponding periods of time.

For this, we are now required to analyze Shadow Lairs, as it the region, which contains so far glanced over Shadow Firestorm Citadel and the miasma of Shadow Gloaming Wildwoods, mentioned briefly in the [analysis of Snarbolax's curse](#snarbolax-and-haunting-through-curse). But, due to sheer size of the topic, its many nuances, _we will decouple the context of Shadow Lairs from the content_. Specifically, we are not concerned with nature or origin of Shadow Lairs and Swarm, but with phenomena which take place in those lairs - miasma and the curse. We will also discuss the causality of those events, with Shadow Firestorm Citadel being our main point of concern in regards to what is considered canon.

After we are done with the properties of the Citadel and Wildwoods, their plausible positions in the timeline, separated from the nature of Shadow Lairs themselves, we will perform the final summary of the metaphysics of curse.

Shadow Lairs are introduced in a manner (`Shadows Fall Over Cradle!` - [Release Notes: 2011.10.19](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2011-10-19)), which suggest, that the boss entities are alive while Spiral Order possess extended knowledge on them, as if they were already encountered:

- `The Gloaming Wildwoods has been infected with a poisonous miasma and the Snarbolax is said to have gone rabid!`
- `The Royal Jelly Palace has frozen over and its king usurped by the true heir to the slimy throne, the frigid Ice Queen!`
- `The Ironclaw Munitions Factory has begun creating in fiery weapons and improved upon its ultimate weapon in the form of the Red Roarmulus Twins!`
- `A powerful curse has overtaken the Firestorm Citadel, transforming its hordes and lead by the mighty Darkfire Lord Vanaduke!`

#### Miasma

The miasma is described as the reason for the change within the Wildwoods: `The Gloaming Wildwoods has been infected with a poisonous miasma and the Snarbolax is said to have gone rabid!`

We can consolidate effects of the miasma to the following properties:

- Enemies affected by the miasma inflict poison.
- Due to miasma, undeath is far more widespread and severe across the Wildwoods.
- Snarbolax, in its shadowy form, gains poisonous properties, in its form resembling Graveyards' tombstones with green glowing veins.
- The Wildwoods are covered with red mist.

When Snarbolax is encountered, apart from being rabid, it is present in multiple instances. We have previously suggested, that [Snarbolax is cursed](#snarbolax-and-haunting-through-curse), with curse accumulating in its hide, granting immortality in a less detrimental manner. Snarbolax was defeated by knights, unless it is not one of its kind, as later suggested by presence of multiple it instances in the Shadow Gloaming Wildwoods and affirmed by [Snarblepup Maskeraith]().

There is also a case of [Vile Engine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine) mission and its [slime generators](), which were the reason for Rotting Metropolis' existence: `It would seem as though those slime generators have been around much longer than we thought, seeping their vile toxins into any levels that should be near them. A modern city, much like those that the devilites inhabit seems to be overrun with these toxins, and was probably left behind by both the devilites and gremlins as a result. Now a legion of slime and undead creatures haunt the place, festering in the poisons that linger in the air. A squad that was attempting to pass through the city has gone missing. Given that the very air is toxic ...` ([The Rotting Metropolis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Rotting_Metropolis)). And in order for miasma to appear, slime generators could be a plausible precedent for existence of poisoned Gloaming Wildwoods and Rabid Snarbolax. Considering that all of Clockwork location can be moved, the prime example being molten cavern of Firestorm Citadel - `The Core was in sight. But now some kind of massive negative energy anomaly has surfaced above the Core, blocking access to it. ... We need you to explore the surrounding levels and collect any intel you can. You can start with an Owlite castle of some sort that recently surfaced near this anomaly` ([Ending in Fire - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ending_in_Fire)), it is plausible for the Wildwoods at some point being affected by the [slime generators](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine/Processing_Plant) at depth 22.

But, on the other hand, the __miasma is most reminiscent of curse due to its red color__, _the color itself makes it distinct from toxic and quicksilver lichens of Vile Engine_. And at that, thematically, it seems to us that gremlins are not ones to be involved in the creation of, at least, Shadow Gloaming Wildwoods. This red mist is similar to one present on fiend-inhabited Clockwork Tunnels, with a characteristic pink hue, the [Infernal Passage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Infernal_Passage).

As it was discussed earlier, we had proposed an existence of a [Vile Deity](#fiendish-cults), who is the reason behind supernatural occurrences related to poison and undeath across graveyards, as well as being here the embodiment of supernatural properties of poison. In case of miasma, the description and setting is fitting, but not the color of mist itself, unless this supernatural nature also exists, one traced back to Underworld.

It is then a question weather Vile Deity actually exists and what is its influence onto material realm. As far as we would not lean to this idea, we can not deny __a theme of poison carrying a supernatural element in its extremes__, starting from [Plague Essence](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plague_Essence): `A powerful essence left behind when a creature perishes from a particularly putrid disease.` as it is a material from the same tier and design as [Everfrost](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Everfrost) and [Flame Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul). It is due to all of covered so far motifs we suggest, that a type of supernatural plague is present here - _an idea of miasma coming from Underworld._

The red mist is the main point of concern and a counter argument for Slime Generators being responsible for the creation of the miasma. So far, a few potential leads can be connected to this phenomenon:

- Red mist is similar to the glow of Maskeraith's [Vengeful Shadow Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vengeful_Shadow_Cloak#Vengeful_Shadow_Cloak). Although the design differs, as Maskeraith cloak has yellow lightning bolts within it, the mist does not. The density of Maskeraith cloak does not allow to see through it, most reminiscent of strong reddish glow and wind below the [Core Terminal](#core-terminal).
- The context of the word _miasma across mythology is usually considered as a divine punishment and illness_. The illness is present in the woods, but the punishment aspect remains unknown.
- The stone lantern found across the woods are similar to the Yukimi-Gata lanterns and 5-layer stone stupas.

Among those proposals, we lean to the idea of the miasma being the result of [collapsing grim gates' portal](#grim-gates-portal-collapse), [described earlier](#grim-gates) in regards to Undercorp sabotaging tortomega efforts. We have proposed, that the reason for this large-scale spread of curse-related affliction is due to [Undercorp turning against Titans](#the-fall-of-titans), erasing their civilization through mechanical change of tortodrones. But, if we consider such scenario, how an event from the past would've made an appearance in the present? This concept, we believe, ties with the greater nature of Shadow Lairs, yet, we have to establish an ongoing motif.

As far as solely Shadow Gloaming Wildwoods allow us to hypothesize, __Miasma came from the Grim Gates back when titans were annihilated by corrupted tortodrones__. On Cradle, miasma reemerges as either the result of still unseen actor - embodied by the Nefarious Imp, or, due to events of [March of Tortodrones](), where the portals were collapsed through intervention of Knights. Given that those event have happened at later point in time, as a singular event similar to other Shadow Lairs, we are leaning to the idea of Undercorp being involved here, while acknowledging still unknown properties of Shadow Lairs, and, separately, a plausibility of a cause in the form of Grim Gates.

#### True Citadel of Almirian Empire

Shadow Firestorm Citadel is in much regard far more dangerous than its regular counterpart. The presence of Nature Sprites and Darkfire Lord Vanaduke, the lack of the console create unique conditions in order for it to exist within the canon.

Shadow Firestorm Citadel is similar to the unknown chronology of frozen over Shadow Royal Jelly Palace within the timeline, including the fact of both had to [contain a console](#gremlin-containments-and-consoles).

To analyze nature of this variant of the Citadel, we have to start by isolating history and design of the concept of Firestorm Citadel.

It is known that it was the Grand Citadel of Almire: `From atop the highest tower of the Grand Citadel of Almire, Vanaduke watched his kingdom crumble. ... Many days later the citizens of Almire watched as fire began to erupt from the mountains. Leading an army of terrible fiends, Vanaduke returned to his kingdom, destroying the occupied forces of the two opposing kingdoms in a single day. In time the two kingdoms fell, Vanaduke's legion burning everything in their path. When he returned to Almire, it burned as well, for everywhere he went, and everything he touched was doomed to ash. With nothing left to destroy, his legions left him and returned to the mountains, leaving the king to sit in his throne of ash and cinder, all the people of Almire dead around him` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall)), and `You stand before the gates of the Firestorm Citadel, the former heart of the great Kingdom of Almire, now a dominion twisted by fire and malice` ([King of Ashes - Blackstone Bridge - Lost Soul](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_(Blackstone_Bridge))).

Kingdom of Almire was located near the volcanic mountains, ones which held an altar to a fiery deity, [which we concluded to be Vog](#blackened-shrine-and-magma-deity), an Underworld deity. Almire's nature-themed designs, as well as a strong connection to Spirit Mother, which was the reason for her intervention, had resulted in capture of several Nature Sprites in the Citadel itself by the time Lord Vanaduke had returned transformed.

At some point, the Citadel and an unknown part of the landmass comprising the kingdom of Almire was captured by the Core, with its cities seemingly intact, as suggested by the [Necropolis Grounds](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Necropolis_Grounds). Starting from it, Firestorm Citadel was permeating through the Clockworks. But, when the Knights have arrived, it anomalously resurfaced in proximity, or even above to the Core:

- `We thought things were getting pretty predictable, even at the depths you've been exploring. The Core was in sight. But now some kind of massive negative energy anomaly has surfaced above the Core, blocking access to it. Recon Knights have said that all they see near it is fire, endless fire. We don't know what it is just yet, but squads near that depth have already gone missing. This is bad news` ([Ending in Fire - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ending_in_Fire)).
- `That mass of negative energy we've been investigating is a portion of an ancient kingdom called Almire, the very same realm described in that Owlite tome you discovered!` ([Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Eye_of_the_Needle)).

Paired with the fact it is instrumental to opening the Core [in the events of Shadowplay](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay), this seems to us as a reason for its movement, orchestrated by an unknown party.

Large number of followed up missions were concerned with getting in proximity of the Citadel:

- `We need you to explore the surrounding levels and collect any intel you can. You can start with an Owlite castle of some sort that recently surfaced near this anomaly` ([Ending in Fire - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ending_in_Fire)).
- `An unlikely source of intel has surfaced from the residents of Moorcroft Manor. A few of the spookats that call it home contacted one of our visiting Recon Knights and provided details of the negative energy mass that has appeared above the Core. Calling it 'a place of burning hatred' and 'a prison for dark souls' they say that you can read all about it in 'one of those weird Owlite books' in an Owlite keep they pinpointed. If what they claim is true Spiral HQ could gain valuable intel from investigating the Owlite keep. Just remember that these Owlite structures have all proven to be swarming with the lost souls of countless undead monsters` ([An Occurrence at Owlite Keep](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/An_Occurrence_at_Owlite_Keep)).

  It directly connects Scarlet Fortress, [The Hall of Remembrance](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/An_Occurrence_at_Owlite_Keep), to the [The Forgotten Library](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Library.png) of Owlite Academy, as it is located in the Candlestick Keep.

- `The Spookats of Moorcroft Manor have another valuable piece of intel for us that is worth investigating. They say that a lost soul of the former Kingdom of Almire resides in a soldier's graveyard near the Firestorm Citadel. This soul is willing to provide us with the information on the nature of the citadel as well as how we can get through it and reach the Core` ([Alone in the Dark](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alone_in_the_Dark)).

  It contain both remains of Owlite Academy, the Candlestick Keep, and cooling chambers of Clockwork tunnels.

- The [Gauntlet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gauntlet) itself is accessed through the Owlite Academy, transitioning, again, into the Scarlet Fortress. This time, notably, it contains most of the hazards, attributed also to gremlins - the freeze traps of cooling chambers. This was covered in the [gremlin containments section](#gremlin-containments-and-consoles). And here, we see more relation to the heavenly kingdom, as if it was surrounding the Citadel.

Here we have to return to the topic of the [Forgotten Time](#analysis-of-forgotten-time), as there we have discussed the possibility of Almire existing on the same planet as heavenly kingdom.

This positioning does raise suspicion, as geographically. Through mythological inspirations, heavenly kingdom had to be located above the land of Ironmight Kingdom, tortomega ruins, including the Wildwoods and the [Veiled Homeland yet-to-become the Aurora Isles](), and the Kingdom of Almire.

As the planet had to be harvested, Aurora Isles would have to eventually end up being captured, but this would not explain the fact they, too, float. Unless the same technology or physical law was used to hold up all of matter in skydomes.

We have mentioned that Carnavons and Slag Zombies have similar design and are only ones with explicit armor. One particular concept we are interested in - _if Carnavons are canon, their curse affliction and Dread Seals are canon, would this make Shadow Firestorm Citadel canon?_ And if so, how would it fit with the existing Firestorm Citadel outside of Shadow Lairs? Physically, all of those location reach Shadow Lairs proper - the [Unknown Passage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Unknown_Passage), - as only boss depths contain the first signs of the Swarm, the rectangular black mist, that is apart from the Gate Icon in prior depths.

Assuming Owlites, as the heavenly kingdom above the mountains, had witnessed the war of 3 kingdoms - Ironmight, Almire, and supposedly Raiders, - they had to stay away from the conflict given lack of their presence. Then Lord Vanaduke has returned from the mountains with the Legion of Ur - of Isoran Wardens transformed to trojans.

As the Legion of Ur had returned into the mountains, as most of the land was burned by Lord Vanaduke's crusade, we have proposed, that became the reason for Valkyries to enact. This period of time and until the Kataclysm had seemed fitting to position Owlites' gunslinger priests, as both those narratives involve undead opposition or danger to heavenly kingdom. It is also in this context we have proposed existence of undead kingdom of Almire as the [Almirian Empire](#almirian-empire).

As far as our hypothesis has allowed, Lord Vanaduke could've begun an invasion into the heavenly kingdom with his undead army of legions of Almire. It is then, either to greater developments in the understanding of curse were made, allowing for Dread Seals to be placed onto carnavons, or, those advancements had followed near the Kataclysm, with a _different party responsible for placement of those Seals in the modern times_ in the paradigm of those Seals belonging to Owlites.

##### Dread Seal: Part 2

Through this logic, we reach the dread seal and ones who bear it [for the second time](#dread-seals).

Dread Seal is acquired from the [Katastrophe Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Katastrophe_Prize_Box), meaning, that it is associated with Owlites to a degree. In the accompanied [news art](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/News/2014), dread seal is placed on the Black Kat Mask, - reminiscent of Margrel, as the [Cowl](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_kat_helm) is acquired from him.

No less important the fact that it is in a set with the Chaos Cloak. Weather or not this design choice is canon, the fact that evil eye makes itself present on Owlite's Chaos Cloak may serve as a link to other Owlite researches regarding nature of curse, as discussed in detail starting from the [Kat Tribe chapter](#chapter-viii-kat-tribe).

As the Chaos Cloak is forbidden, the dread seal places with it seem to suggest it being a mark of danger, or a restriction. As discussed earlier, __Dread Seal's design is closely similar to the known design of the Fu talisman__, _meant to hinder a supernatural entity._ It is placed by a priest. We have assumed those priests being the gunslinger priests of heavenly kingdom, of originally valkyries, as those a deeply connected to concept of divinity.

Then it is the roster of the [Katastrophe Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Katastrophe_Prize_Box) which we have to discuss. Items, attributes to Margrel due to their design all have "Dread" used to characterize them:

- [Dreadful Aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreadful_Aura#Dreadful_Aura)
- [Dread Wings](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Wings)
- [Dread Seal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Seal)

Dreadful aura and wings possess a design, which is reminiscent of trojans, - of a cracked, stone-like form, with pink curse glow from within. But the distinctive feature of Margrel's undead organic accessories is the shivering, characteristic of all Black Kats.

As far as common __design patterns related to curse go, trojans follow them with 2 exceptions__: their color is bright pink and they don't inflict curse.

As Undead family of monsters is affected or imbued by the curse, Black Kats, Margrel most prominently, and Carnavons, are ones to be empowered by the condition. And Darkfire Lord Vanaduke, but he lacks the seal present.

Then, there is [Faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Faust). It has the seal, yet its color is different, more sickly pink, with [Gran Faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gran_Faust) being the closest to trojans' color of flames of bright pink.

Given application of Crest of Ur in Gran Faust, symbolically, we propose to reconsider trojans as not only transformed Wardens, but curse-bearing, [relatively sentient fiends](#silent-legion), similar to [Darkfire Lord Vanaduke](#nature-of-darkfire).

With the prior knowledge on Black Kats, Almire and [application of Dread Seal design in Owlite technology](#dread-seals), we will present the last argument in favour of dread seals being created by Owlites.

Carnavons possess a painted dark-pink curse symbol on their blackened shields. This is closely similar to the design of a cursed knight, as his gear - weapons, - are marked with the same symbol, preventing usage of the latter. Presence of the dread seal on the front could be explained only by its nature to restrict the curse, which seems as a benevolent action.

This would coincide with their last actions of Warding Candles being placed, as another measure to defend against Underworld and purification of Gran Faust into the Divine Avenger. In relation to Almire, the seal is placed onto Carnavons to hinder them. _The only time this would chronologically fit, is when Owlites had to confront the undead Almirian Empire._ But, as much as this plot would seem fitting, __we do not see it as the case here__, as no evidence, apart from undead being present in the academy, there are.

As far as the setting is restricted by the game itself, it could be a plausible enemy type to fill in this undead-themed region.

##### Color-coded Citadel

Dark Embers are acquired for Almirian Seal tokens, are said to be `salvaged from Lord Vanaduke's throne room. It slowly smolders with a sinister intensity, creating an almost hypnotic trance when gazed upon for any length of time` ([Dark Ember](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember)), which would only be thematically fitting - through color purple, - if the entire Citadel was of that theme, so their presence in the regular fiery Citadel would be odd, or implying eexistence of the shadow variant.

But, it is the only this distinct evidence of, supposedly, darkfire existing outside of Shadow Lairs and color of fire in the fire bowls.

It was previously discussed that Vog's fiery curse, the reason for Vog Cubs' existence, is the other curse related to more fire. Through this logic we followed to the idea of darkfire being a distinct phenomenon in the [nature of darkfire section](#nature-of-darkfire).

There, we have presented 2 proposal to the nature of darkfire - a regular by now variant of curse, and a distinct creation emerging from Vog's curse being overtaken by different Underworld's curse. _Darkfire would not have a reason to exist in the throne room engulved by regular fire_, which is paraphrasing of the thematic inconsistency, if not framed into a context of Darkfire Lord Vanaduke's mask curse-colored fire soul, as a distinct and unique phenomenon.

It was stated that army within the Citadel was transformed - that would eventually mean that all Slag Walkers had turned into Carnavons. Yet both are present across Clockworks outside of Shadow Lairs. Carnavons are summoned by Black Kats, which are themselves summoned by the Dark ritual which can pull banished entities from the Underworld, such as trojans.

This, so far, creates 2 interpretation of the Shadow Firestorm Citadel:

- It is the latest state Citadel is found, following the events of [Shadowplay]().

  Carnavons being marked by Dread Seals here could be only be explained by, either:

  - Inhabitants of heavenly kingdom still existing in order to place those seals.
  - Carnavons existing prior to present events, which would contradict the idea of regular Firestorm Citadel.

  Or, dread seals are of Underworld's origin, being applied by fiends onto creatures within the material realm.
- Shadow Firestoem Citadel is an anomaly unexplainable by currently known logic, existing in parallel to Firestorm Citadel.

    The 2 issues of this explanation come from the idea of Lord Vanaduke being potentially resurrected, and that an entire copy of the Citadel exists on Cradle.

As both of those explanation are incomplete, we have to discuss 3 currently existing variants of the Firestorm Citadel in order to categorize most of their differences for our investigation.

##### Firestorm, Greenstone, Darkfire Citadel

To start off, there are differences between Firestorm, Shadow Firestorm Citadel, and 'Greenstone' Citadel of Shadowplay.

Designs of Greenstone Citadel and Firestorm Citadel are essentially the same. This follows with the idea of Shadow Lairs not being canon. The _Overgrown Court has a part of Ashen Armory fallen to its level_, which coincides with the general structure of Greenstone Citadel's less stable state, as it crumbles: `We all sensed the moment you defeated Vanaduke. The entire citadel shook as he fell and for a moment we thought that this realm would be destroyed along with its ruler. You must be careful wandering these halls with the place coming apart like this!` ([Shadowplay - Overgrown Court - Nature Sprite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Overgrown_Court)). There are notable elements within the Shadow Firestorm Citadel, which frame it in s similar light:

- Much larger in quantity presence of metal chains. All chains, both positioned in the same places as in the regular citadel and ones added in those depth are much larger.
- More ramping arches present across the buildings surrounding the main area of depths, a less notable architectural change.
- Presence of wooden watchtowers and their usage as, seemingly, reinforcements for the brickwork structure of buildings.
- Almirian tapestry in several instances across the Shadow Firestorm Citadel is much larger in scale, as chains.
- Most of fire bowls have their yellow fire replaced with purple, which we suggested to be dark embers and dark fire, as the same design is present in relation to undead locations, which also was a contributor to nature of darkfire as a regular phenomenon out of Underworld.
- Grim totems are more deeply integrated into the designs of Shadow Firestorm Citadels.

  In both regular and shadow citadel, presence of totems is questionable, apart from game design perspective as undead levels. Unless, those were introduced by devilites.

- Far more areas are blocked off by wooden and brickwork debris, areas, designated to specific depths or route variations in it, are collapsed in a haphazard manner, with extending passages being broken off.

##### Darkfire Lord Vanaduke and <span class="through-curse">Damnation through curse</span>

Darkfire Lord Vanaduke's design _differs greatly_ from Lord Vanaduke of Firestorm Citadel:

- One of the most notable element is presence of an _intact purple hooded cloak_ of Darkfire Lord Vanaduke.

    Almire's crest shown on its _back is most intact with an additional spiked design_, compared to the torn, as [Almirian tapestries](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almire_Furniture#Doodads) and the torn cape of Firestorm Citadel's Lord Vanaduke.
- The clothes below Vanaduke's armor, as well as the cloak, have the same triangular pattern in the design of _not crudely sawn rags, but far more finely preserved royal clothes._

    This triangular pattern is most similar to Underworld's shadow steel patterns associated with Nefarious Imp and gear made of shadow steel.

    The hooded royal cloak ends with the triangular white-outlined shapes at the base of the black tree of Almire's Crest.
- The armor of Darkfire Lord Vanaduke has the similar thematic change. _It has no visible bolts_ and is generally more monolithic, - the face plate and chest. While the characteristic chains had remained, they are now present all across the Citadel.

    Moreover the part of armor around the face has more symbolic elements, a circle of outwards extending spikes, similar to a star or normal damage projectiles. Considering the general motif of a prison, we suggest it being related to a medieval torture device, iron maiden specifically.

    Another interpretation to be found here, is of implications of the coins and emblem of [Ironmight Kingdom](#ironmight-shield-crowns-and-coins), referencing stars and seemingly reign over them. If Almirian Empire did incorporate all of those kingdoms, then this would thematically be reflected in it.

So, unknown party had applied a curse onto the Citadel, which influenced the resulted state the Citadel is found in the Shadow Lairs, _far more fortified and dilapidated than it was found_ during [The King of Ashes]().

sThen the presence of Almire-aligned undead, including the royal guard - they, too, had to be justified to be present only in the Shadow Firestorm Citadel.

All of those elements make __Shadow Firestorm Citadel far more authentic, compared to the Firestorm Citadel outside of Shadow Lairs__. Presence of Dark Embers following curse theme should be a reason for this variant being the true one, an yet, Greenstone Citadel has all of the initial designs of the Firestorm Citadel.

Due ot those properties we will expand upon the first explanations presented in previous section, and present a 3rd scenario of integrating the Citadel into the timeline:

- Shadow Firestorm Citadel symbolically represents the Citadel of the undead Almirian Empire at its most ready state.

    Shadow Lairs with unknown actor from Underworld, through transformative power of curse, had transformed present Firestorm Citadel into one completely overtaken by the curse, transforming Almirian designs into fiendish.

    Presence of still cursed Vanaduke's finery would suggest, that Lord Vanaduke's soul still lingers, and this would've allowed for it to be brought back into fiendish armor, paralleling trojans' design, contrasting Spiral Wardens, and, in terms of resurrection - Margrel.
- Shadow Firestorm Citadel is one traversed by the knights, placing it before the mission of King of Ashes, as Lord Vanaduke is required to live at this point in time.

    This approach would discard the event of the mission itself, rendering them not canon, _negating entire story arc_. This approach would also contradict the boss trophies, as all of them do not account for Shadow Lairs, while the regions themselves were seemingly pulled to the higher depths.

    This seems less likely, as we are yet to discover cases of retcon such as described above. It is due to implausibility of such scenario, despite conflict presented by Dark Embers, we are considering the idea of a time when carnavons were marked as such in the past, but with the curse affecting the Citadel in the modern times.

Lastly, we should note a possibility of _purple-colored Dread Seal being attributed to Underworld_ - as Faust, - and only gold seal belonging to Owlites, derived from the dread seal. __This would remove altogether a necessity for Carnavons to be marked with the seals by heavenly kingdom__, apart from their presence with Kats and populating the Academy. Given lack of any mentions of such war taking place, we would consider it as nonexistent.

As for dark embers - in this interpretation, they would remain as an outlier, but now explained as a characteristic element of cursed corporeal entities met by Vog's fires, with darkness present only in the innermost regions of the source of curse - in proximity of Lord Vanaduke, as it would reveal the nature of the affliction as Underworldly not in Darkfire Lord Vanaduke's design, but description. Existence of Dark Embers would be justified, if it is meant to be acquired by the time Darkfire Citadel was traversed. This would also _link back with the themes seen so far, of Undercorp being the perpetrator, responsible for the curse of the Citadel_ on the greater scale, concentration, and intensity [compared to the miasma]().

In this case, __the supposed revival of Lord Vanaduke__, suggested by his lingering presence in boss trophies - of his mask, paralleling zombie's skulls, __rebinding of his soul to a specifically crafted armor of Shadow Steel, yet with the original mask__ would seem as _a showcase of extreme means Undercorp would go,_ and as evidence of the [mask being container for the soul]().

Given the very existence of this proposed notion, Undercorp had to be connected to the Core, and supposedly the source of energy with the ends of accessing directly the souls used to be gathered and routed into the Apocrean Realm through Underworld.

At that, the only time such scenario would be plasuible, is _after the events of Shadowplay_, as there are, we believe, sevaral argumants for this:

- `Firestorm Citadel continues to burn with accursed flames. Though the nature sprites have been steadily making progress in fighting the flames, something or someone has recently caused a violent resurgence in its destructive power. Spiral HQ requests that you gather together a crack squad of knights and return to the collapsing ruins of Firestorm Citadel in order to discover the source of the disturbance` ([Shadowplay](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay)).
- `We were in the middle of receiving a report from Lieutenant Vaelyn's team at the Core Terminal when our signal was disrupted. It took some time, but I've managed to pinpoint the source of the disruption. It's coming from that strange device you discovered near Vanaduke's throne room in Firestorm Citadel. It seems like someone has activated it` ([The Flickering Flame - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Flickering_Flame))

Those factors, we propose, despite the fact the Artificat is placed by Herex after the knight arrives to the Console, serve as the foundation for the link between Artifact's energy and its unfluence onto metapysics of curse, powering it in the same manner as the energy contained within the mineral serves as the conduit and a battery.

Due to the Artifcat remaining in the Console, we suggest, that it is its influnce, paired with opening of the Core, and later timely involvement of Undercorp, which had led to the result of Firestorm Citadel becoming even more cursed, but now repurposed directly for Undersorp's plans on Cradle and status quo of Core opening.

#### Evil Eye Appearances, Themes, and Curse

Now, We will reiterate upon all instances of evil eye and curse in general. We will attempt to identify properties and patterns based on the established narratives and reasonable implications, observed across the timeline up until this point.

Symbol of the eye, [dread seal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Seal) and symbol of curse within the status effect classification of Spiral Order all have similar designs, which can be summarized as a _an opened eye with 3 strokes or dots below in radial pattern._ Occasionally, one dot or stoke above the eye is seen.

This design is similar to the _Hand of Fatima or Eye of Miriam_, which in its most common form is shaped like a hand with three extended fingers in the middle and a curved thumb and pinky fingers on the sides. Here, it seem to possess an inverted effect within the Spiral Knights cosmology.

Another potential inspiration for eye's design is prominent presence of the particular [eye symbol](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_Symbol) across _Legend of Zelda setting and franchise_. While it is also _hypothesized to be inspired eye of Horus_, as the evil eye of Spiral Knights, the potential notion of the prior serving as an inspiration for the latter is plausible due to at least one inspiration from a different game: `Haven's original look resembled something similar to a Ald'ruhn from The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind. As you might imagine, it really didn't look right. Thank goodness we hired Cory!` ([10 things you didn't know about Spiral Knights](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/20773)).

As most of instances of curse are connected to Underworld and depictions of the evil eye, those will be covered first.

- For the first time, evil eye is seen as a color pattern on [Greavers' wings](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greaver).
  - Elemental Greavers have the pattern glowing in accordance to their elemental theme and status effect, apart from the curse itself, which as a common motif, not seen explicitly.
  - Greavers have metal helms with an eye as a visor, which we proposed to be a common design across legions of Underworld, connecting it with the Nefarious Imp.
- Tortodrones' shell plates have evil eye carved on them, possessing a red glow in enraged state.
  - Artificially derived [tortodrone shell gear](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Shell) has mineral-related glow of those eyes.
- Graviton [Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graviton_Bomb) has a symbol of an antique evil eye carved on it. The explosion of the bomb resembles the grim gate's opened portal vortex, without leading to dark city, instead having a dark core. The vortex is then followed by an explosion with an imagery of an antique evil eye.
  - Similar vortex resulting of the explosion is present in [Grim Gates](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Fiend_Gate.png) during their portal collapse, but this instance has presence of curse-colored vortex, identical to maelstrom of dark ritual in Moorcroft Manor.
  - Presence of Margrel is characterized by the the aforementioned case of the maelstrom of curse supposedly pouring from the Underworld and a location wherein Black Kats did come from.
- Antique evil eye in present on [heavy statues](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Heavy_Statue.png). They have troika-like weapon and helm in its shape resembling a devilite, with a characteristic single eye.
  - Evil eye symbol is seen on the titans of the titan arcade gates. We concluded tat the statue and titan are the same entity.
- Snarbolax is cursed, but has it contained within its fur, which grants it its defenses and ability to exist and haunt after death. It has themes of haunting and supernaturally seeing eyes.
- [Nefarious Imp raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nefarious_Raiment) and [hood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nefarious_Hood) have highly advanced designs incorporating a more abstract version of evil eye imagery.
  - That armor, helm specifically, has a glowing symbol of evil eye similar to [Gran Faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gran_Faust).
  - Same advanced shape was seen on Gran Faust and Faust guards.
- A 90-degree rotated antique evil eye is depicted within the front cloth pattern of the Chaos Cloak. Chaos Cloak has themes of curse being seemingly a part of universal whole within Nameless Realm.
- The dread seal contains image of the evil eye.
  - Dread seal is present on [Carnavons](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Carnavon#Carnavon), warriors of Almire. Their bear similar concentrated degree of curse as Black Kats, their claws are of dark matter form the supposed influence of darkfire - merging or Underworld's curse and Vog's curse into a single phenomenon.
    - [Darkfire Lord Vanaduke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Darkfire_Vanaduke) has same dark matter claws, and is immortal, while being maddened, cursed by the fiery deity Vog.
  - The Seal is also present on [Margrel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Margrel), in addition, [black kats](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat#Black_Kat) being both summoned ([1](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kataclysmic_Confrontation), [2](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Book_of_Dark_Rituals)) - the former are summoned all across known Clockworks and Margrel is summoned through a [dark ritual](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Book_of_Dark_Rituals).
    - [Mewkats](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mewkat#Mewkat) are closely related to black kats as both being grimalkin transformed into Undead - a parallel to citizens and legion of Almire.
    - [Grimalkin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mewkat#Grimalkin) emerge in areas covered by an unnatural darkness, one being related to Underworld through Philoso's research of Undead.
      - Research of Undead was possibly performed by Titans before discovery of Underworld proper.
  - [Seraphynx the Black Kat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphynx_(Black_Kat)#Gallery) battle sprite transformed by the Core has the same Seal present under certain conditions of evolution, combining divinity of heavenly kingdom and curse-aligned nature of post-Kataclysm Kat Tribe.
- [Trojans](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Trojan), including Arkus have dark matter crystal embedded, trojans of tier 3 and resurrected Arkus have the crystal burning in pink flame.
  - The purple flame is closely related to [Dark Embers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember), the latter is related to Lord Vanaduke's curse, Underworld.
  - Trojans and corrupted tortodrones petrify once the dark matter inside is destroyed, releasing purple mist, similar to [Baleful Aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Baleful_Aura#Baleful_Aura).
  - Trojans [were sealed in the Underworld](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur) but do not possess the dread seal, an idea of the seal devised in the Underworld.
  - Undead [Dreadnaughts](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreadnaught) can inflict curse while being not a curse-ridden entities, but they are linked through power to resurrect to the grim totems.
- Apocrea, while without evil eye symbolism, is an entity of shadow damage and an eldritch god, with similar futuristic designs of the city, close to ones of Nefarious Imp armor, yet without sign of curse present within.
- Explicit curse seals forbid some of abilities of a sealed entity.
  - The [Cursed Nature Sprites](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel/Charred_Court) could not establish a link to Spirit Mother and its realm.
  - Curse placed on Knight disallows it to inflict damage.
  - Seal and curse-afflicting attacks of of [Black Kats](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Margrel) may symbolize their banished nature, or, as recently discussed, connection to Undercorp.
  - Seals of [Sealed Sword](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sealed_Sword) restricts its power output.
  - Seals on Lumbers, apart from void lumbers, as they lack the seal, hide the essence which might power the tree trunk through tethering of a soul or an elemental essence, sealing it within the mechanical components. This essence if dropped on host's defeat.

Entities imbued with curse last far longer under unnatural means and have amplified power compared to their nature prior to being afflicted with curse:

- Lord Vanaduke and Darkfire Lord Vanaduke, Margrel, black kats, carnavons, trojans - generally live for more than thousand of years.
- In some instances they are resistant to curse: devilites and Vanaduke, fiends in general.
- Armors and gear explicitly related to Underworld and curse of their owners are weak to curse, while items related to divinity are strongly resistant to curse. The latter are often presented as divine or holy.

In relation to gremlins, gremlin technology and Clockworks:

- The [Collector](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Collector) has antique evil eye drawn around its central eye, and backpack of bombs has the sigil with the eye.
  - [Lumber](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lumber) created by gremlins have paper seals placed onto them, the same sealed sword is wrapped in.
    - Lumbers drop essences. Although this could be thematic feature for the sake of loot table consistency of tier 3.
  - Collector's backpack has the same symbol as echo blocks, which also contain a depiction of an eye.
- The Swarm has a similar eye [pointing downwards](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/The_Path_is_Revealed).
  - Core's enemy onslaught [gates](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/A_Step_Beyond) have evil eye present of same curse-themed color of dark pink and purple, with an iris of larger size.
  - Core's respawn pads have 3 dots, similar to 3-dot eye of Apocrea of Underworld and Scarabs.

As for the immortal explicit bearers of curse:

- Darkfire Lord Vanaduke

  - Inflicts curse: Yes
  - Lightning arcs: Yes (when disembodied mask)
  - Burning: Yes (limbs, cursed fire soul behind the mask)

  - Lightning arcs: No
  - Burning: No
  - Dark matter presence: No
  - Unstable form: Yes (baleful aura)
  - On defeat: melts, yellow explosions

Here would propose a concept which was partially referred to near the [analysis of the nature of darkfire](), since we have established a connection between trojans and Spiral Wardens.

What if the pink fire of trojans is indeed a separate, native to Underworld, manifestation of curse, hence the reason for its distinct separation from the purple darkfire of material realm?

If the Shadow Firestorm Citadel was influenced by the curse to the point of its fires in the fire bowls turning purple, why trojans had remains unaffected? Both this and the distinguished color, yet identical to charged dark matter, seems us as if trojans have become native to Underworld to the point of being __unaffected by curse as part of their nature__, similar to Greavers, whose symbolism of the eye does not correspond to them inflicting curse.

For the rest of species coming from the material realm, curse is the identified of them transitioning to the fiendish nature of Underworld.

The counterpart to curse - a concept of divinity or sainthood, is also found in [Saintly Silver Amulet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Saintly_Silver_Amulet), [Sacred Silver Amulet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sacred_Silver_Amulet) and [Blessed Silver Amulet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blessed_Silver_Amulet).

It is also here we should note on the sacred characteristic of 5-star upgrades of the [Padded Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Padded_Armor), with helms reminiscent of older ages. The descriptions also make if seems as if the __entire alchemy tree of Padded Armor, as it is designed for handgun combat - is the modern reemergence of gunslinger priests:__

- `A spectral suit of armor for those who are gunning for ghosts` ([Sacred Snakebite Ghost Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sacred_Snakebite_Ghost_Armor)).
- `A phantasmal suit of armor for those who are aiming for the infernal` ([Sacred Falcon Hex Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sacred_Falcon_Hex_Armor)).

Due to this, we believe, the eye represents more than curse itself, but presence of Underworld, which manifests itself in a causal manner through applications of curse as one ot its essentials. It is die to abundant presence of curse, the eye may be mistaken to represent curse. But we had to keep in mind, that curse itself is characterized by presence of Underworld in the material realm, leading to an aformentioned connection.

#### Metaphysical Restriction

The curse can be externally applied, which takes form of a metaphysic restriction placed upon an entity, such as:

- Cursed Nature Sprites are unable to establish a link to a different realm - Spirit Mother's Realm.
- A knight under curse can attack only through the attack backfiring.
- Seals placed onto weapons block or direct inwards part fo their power - prime example being Sealed Sword.
- Sealed entities - Carnavons, Black Kats, Lumbers, - are instances of this concept applied thematically and functionally. Only elemental Lumbers possess a seal, is attributed to essence or a soul keeping them operational within an artificially constructed body.

    Carnavons and Black Kats are marked by the seal, which, given their current condition, blocks so far unseen fraction of their influence onto material realm. Given [Dazzling Light Ray](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dazzling_Light_Ray#Dazzling_Light_Ray): `The ray of light deals extra damage to undead and fiend family monsters`, seal's function can be interpreted as one forbidding greater damage to species of material realm, or, in a more recent interpretation, attributing it to Undercorp, _a tool to tether the soul outside of specificity of Cradle's metaphysics._

A restriction manifests through application of a seal, in a most basic form, as seen on elemental lumbers and Sealed Sword, it restricts the function of an object, and, as with lumbers seem to tether a soul to a corporeal body. A more advanced usage - as the apparition of a seal, - is seen through presence of the Dread Seal, placed onto Carnavons and Black Kats.

##### Tortodrone's Case and Gorgofist

A more nuanced relation of curse and constructs is seen in tortodrones, whose shell hides charged crimsonite or dark matter. Given previous motifs, we propose, that carved eyes on the shells are meant to surround the power pistons and contain the mineral as it is drained as power source by the pistons.

In case of corrupted tortodrones, due to presence of dark matter, and tempering by Undercorp, a more advanced method of containment is used - that of ritual circle devised to contain the encircled object. As mineral pillars are secured by sigils within a pentacle, so those sigils are carved onto the shells. Given case of lumbers, the prior technique seems less developed, as it was used primarily by civilization of material realm, see the case of Faust and Sealed Sword.

So, we settle with an idea of fiendish, more complex mechanism of securing mineral, power source, through the system, derived from The Key of Solomon the King, rather that simpler creating of rudimentary seals.

The role of Gorgofist than starts to make sense - this is a dark matter weapon, but it lacks sigil carvings, instead possessing eyes of ancient shells - as it is not devised by Undercorp, but, most likely, reverse engineered.

#### Physical Transformation

The more curse is integrated into nature of an affected entity, the more this entity becomes detached from properties of material realm and approaches the nature of Underworld, going through a process of transformation of a body, but not of the soul. The body in the Underworld is malleable, as suggested by origin of gorgos. The soul is universal, as it is the medium of energy.

From those entities which are most affected by curse, we believe, are trojans of legion of Ur, Arkus, Black Kats, and Lord Vanaduke. If the bearer of the curse was dead, the soul would leave it, with only traces remaining, as discussed in [haunting section](#haunting). But, on Cradle the soul can be tethered to a body through external means, which we had concluded being the presence of the Core. There is also Underworld, which, through Undercorp keeps operating subtly.

This process of bounding of a souls for constructs is achieved though application of a seal, described above. It seems that the seal has the same property as Owlite texts, through presence of specific symbol, which by the fact of being written, grant the underlying matter power across multiple realms. Same can be thought of the fiendish ritual circles, as their pattern defines their properties and function.

The curse can be transformed into a heavenly magic, as seen in the Divine Avenger. Yet, in its nature, curse is natural. It is an essential element of Underworld and Nameless Realm, which is perceived as curse in the material realm due to differences of laws of physics between those realms.

#### Immortality through curses

In greater scope, evil eye is a sign of relation to Underworld, seen in such instances as Kat Tribe raiments and Collector's eye and explosion, which is reminiscent of the graviton and electron bombs.

In that interpretation and arising notion, before delving into the Swarm, the curse has a tendency of giving greater power and flawed immortality in exchange for the change in nature of said beings, aligning them with the Underworld.

The fiends themselves are immune to curse and incorporate it to the extremes as part of their physiology. Entities which incorporate [curse](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Curse) to the fullest are weak to piercing or celestial/divine damage originating from Heavens, contained in the refined [Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore) - [Sun Silver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Silver), as they are identified as fiends.

Presence of the Celestial Ore and Sun Silver highlights the widespread presence in the material realm. It is the nature of Heavens which lies at their properties. The celestial, heavenly theme originates from the Nameless Realm or the realm Sprite Mother exists, it is the origin of souls and auras, which are the concrete cases of universal medium of energy, emerging from crystal and mist energy.

This energy flows from the upper Nameless Realm, settles in the material realm, and souls, after death of a host, depart into the Underworld. Within it, Apocrean Realm, Underworld proper and Blinding Abyss are all sustained by souls, or the energy.

Due to this, it is the universality of energy which grants immortality, binding through curse a soul - a pocket of energy - to a corporeal body, allowing it to be _reanimated indefinitely_. Lingering of a souls manifests as shadow damage, as it is directed by an undeparted soul, with the body being a physical actor.

#### Alchemical Transmutation

The thematic duality of chaos and nothingness is most present in dark matter mineral and Nameless Realm. Through this duality, curse is disregarded as any other natural phenomenon, one conforming to alchemical transmutation and laws of the universe.

The theme of this duality will be explored in the next chapter, fully deriving from alchemical meaning.

It is then established how curse manifests itself in the material realm. So far we have seen a large set of possibilities of curse being applied or manifested. But, what if this concept to be expanded upon by asking a following question.

How would curse manifest itself, if it to be presented to the Nameless Realm directly - how this concept of metaphysical restriction would behave itself when introduced to physics of a realm, which is supposedly the source of all energy, the foundation of the Universe and a raw material/energy for souls to manifest?

Across the analysis we were noting different elements of gremlin technology, society, and what came of them. But in order to attain the fullest and deepest understanding of gremlin civilization, we need to analyze its history from several different perspectives in the similar manner as our previous discussions regarding valkyrian, titan, devilite, Isoran, and Owlite civilizations.

#### Iron Law

We begin with the Great Colony and its relation to Iron Law. Most of the general and relatively direct trivia regarding gremlin civilization's past and present is found in Haven, as well as from a few other places. But, due to unreliability of the sources, we have to come off a position, where those source are only half-truths.

- `Emberlight founded by Gremlin outcasts from Great Colony. Gremlins of Emberlight not obey the Iron Law, so flee or die. We start over with Emberlight. New colony home to few of us: most ex-schemers, some merchants, some fighters, all traitors in the eyes of Great Colony Gremlins` ([The Lab - Pakrat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pakrat#Dialogue)).

    Emberlight is a town in Clockworks. There is a correlation between idea of Iron Law and hostility towards Spiral Order. Moreover, the culture of banishment is presented here, mainly through disobedience to the Iron Law, which moves an individual to seemingly, bottom of gremlin social hierarchy, an outcast outside of the Great Colony.

    As we will explore [soon, there are seemingly other methods of punishment](camp-crimson), apart from banishment.

    The idea of those gremlins seen as traitors presumes that the term of a traitor is detrimental to a societal goal. [Merriam-Webster dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/traitor) defines traitor as `one who betrays another's trust or is false to an obligation or duty`. With this, Iron Law seems to be instrumental to modern-day gremlin civilization, as going against it is considered treachery.

- `All gremlins belonging to the colony serve King Tinkinzar. Tinkinzar is said to be a great ruler and mechanical genius, responsible for the vision of the whole Clockworks. It is our understanding however that the kind is never seen by common gremlins, but instead his orders are delivered and carried out by his Crimson Order, a fearful and zealous band of gremlins who alone share audience with the great king` ([Haven - Bootshuze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Bootshuze#Dialogue)).

  We have to keep in mind, that a potential element of unreliability might be present here through the wording of `Tinkinzar is said to be` and `It is our understanding`.

  Form here on out we will branch into 2 scenarios of interpreting the idea of a king Tinkinzar, as we will later see: he can be a no more than a fabricated idea, a mythic figure, or as a historical figure, whose actions led to such impression to be created among Strangers.

- `Tinkinzar not seen for many many years. Crimson Order carries out Tinkinzar's plans for Cradle. Emberlight was blight on master plan because built by outcasts. Haven was probably the same, founded by non-Gremlins. Not part of plan!` ([Pakrat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pakrat#Dialogue)).

    This assumes, that Iron Law is enforced by Crimson Order and supposedly, by the king as `his orders are delivered and carried out by his Crimson Order` ([Haven - Bootshuze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Bootshuze#Dialogue)).

    Then there is a vague plan, significant enough for Emberlight to be a hindrance to it. We would speculate it potentially being related to Clockworks' purpose, given `Tinkinzar is said to be a great ruler and mechanical genius, responsible for the vision of the whole Clockworks` ([Haven - Bootshuze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Bootshuze#Dialogue)). But, a different suggestion can be potentially presented. As there is an established principle of being banished from Great Colony, with Emberlight being largest known settlement of ones not obeying the Iron Law, one can suggest the plan being only means for Emberlight destruction.

- `A village of outcasts, Emberlight serves as a refuge for gremlins who were banished from the Great Colony. Now they live humble lives, selling wares and repairs to passing travelers, always fearful that one day the gremlin king Tinkinzar would see fit to wipe them out entirely` ([Emberlight](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Emberlight)).

  Here it is phrased as if Tinkinzar is still present and directly oversees the plan, mentioned by Pakrat.

- `We believe they are developing some kind of weeping they're calling 'Project R' that will be targeting Haven itself. Spiral HQ and the Strangers themselves are requesting that you investigate the matter given your performance in the Royal Jelly Palace` ([An Explosive Plot - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/An_Explosive_Plot)).

    As Strangers and Haven seemingly existed not long enough to witness creation of Cradle, we have assumed them being alien species to the planet. But, as gremlin civilization had existed nearly as long, assuming them being at least partially responsible for Clockworks' existence, why only now, as the Knights have settles in Haven, it had to be targeted?

    If we consider that Haven was targeted only now, as Emberlight is supposedly under risk, and given hostility of Iron Law gremlins towards knights, seeing outcast gremlins as traitors, we would propose, that presence of Spiral Order is also a hindrance to those plans and purpose of Iron Law.

- `Project R appears to be in fact two massive weapons known as the 'Roarmulus Twins.' Designed by one of the Crimson Order itself, the Roarmulus Twins are some kind of construct cannon that the gremlins intend on moving up the Clockworks into the Haven Arcade!` ([Target Acquired - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Target_Acquired)).
- `Warmaster Seerus is the evil master of munitions within the gremlin's all-powerful Crimson Order. Thought to be the true mastermind behind the Roarmulus Twins and countless other gremlin weapons, he is the Crimson Order‚Äôs creator and supplier for their diabolical engines of war. Recon Knights under the command of Lieutenant Feron recently discovered Seerus‚Äôs ‚ÄòGrand Arsenal,‚Äô his development center and storage facility for all his weaponry. Now, Feron himself is leading several squads of knights directly into the Grand Arsenal, with the intention of weeding out Seerus and destroying his war machines. Met with heavy resistance, Feron‚Äôs squads require reinforcements and Spiral HQ is sending you in to assist` ([Operation Crimson Hammer](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2012-02-29)).

    This positions Seerus as one following either Tinkinzar's command, or the Iron Law in general.

- `A very convincing costume that makes the wearer look like a gremlin. its so convincing, you just might receive an invitation to the Colony!` ([Gremlin Disguise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlin_Disguise)).

    The colony wih the capital "C" refers here to the Great Colony, as no other settle of an implied scope was established.

- `The Iron Law is Broken! The Crimson Order is False! The Nine are blind, they cannot see the Truth that lies below. The Nine are deaf, they cannot hear the Resonance that beats within this world. Herex no longer serves as one of the Nine. Only Herex sees and hears the Truth. Only Herex will prevail. Follow Herex and you will be spared` ([Spark And Roar - Hidden Hideout - Herex: Danger Module](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Danger_Module:_Hidden_Hideout)).

    Here we are interested only in the nature of the Iron Law. But, compared to Seerus and Crimson Order in general, Herex's understanding of Iron Law seems to suggest it in some capacity is be broken, while Crimson Order, which, as we hypothesized, enforces it, is completely false, - or flawed in its existence or beliefs. This mindset seemingly stems from the _idea of the Order not acknowledging the "Truth" or the "Resonance"._

    While those terms are particularly vague as seen through the lens of Herex's unreliable narration, we are interested in a long term in the reason of this mindset, as we have assumed, that Crimson Order should've had most complete understanding of Cradle and Clockworks. So them being for an unknown reason "blind" to the "Truth" makes it more nuanced. Potentially, even in relation to cosmic horror motifs.

- `The Nine see all, hear all ... King Tinkinzar alone upholds the Iron Law!` ([Operation Crimson Hammer - Engines of War]()).

    This presumes, that the Crimson Order is not the one enforcing Iron Law, but a mythical figure of a king. An interpretation of this relation can be of the terms of order and king being used within state's hierarchy, as a monarchy.

    Here, the Order is a formal body under patronage of a king, which also acts as a proxy for king's authority (`Crimson Order carries out Tinkinzar's plans for Cradle` - [Pakrat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pakrat#Dialogue)).

With this information, we can outline basic premise and relation between those terms:

- A state of gremlin civilization on Cradle, centered at the Great Colony, reigned by Crimson Order and king Tinkinzar, is maintained through the concept of Iron Law.
- Within Great Colony, disobeying the Iron Law is considered treachery. It becomes an explicitly harmful act towards the state, as a breach of trust or loyalty.

    Through this, Iron Law is characterized as an instrumental element of Great Colony's reign. On the topic of a breach of trust, based on potentially delusional Seerus's quote - `King Tinkinzar alone upholds the Iron Law`, - we can link act of treachery being considered as such, as it goes against the vision or global plans of king Tinkinzar by an act of disobeying.

- There exists an idea of a master plan, which is allegedly devised by Tinkinzar and enforced by Crimson Order within the context of Cradle.

    Under this directive, existence of Emberlight and Spiral Order in Haven is harmful to plan's execution.
- The Iron Law, based on Herex's perception and a position as member of Crimson Order, is suggested to be a tangible concept within the network of relations involving the Swarm and the Core.

    Based on this, we can conclude, that the idea of Iron Law being considered broken even by members of the Order would also be considered a betrayal, as Herex operates in secrecy (`Schemer Razwog: Work away from the others. The Order must never know we have the artifact. Find a way to power it. Bring it to me. Do not betray me. I will know` - [Crossing the Chasm - Journey to Haven - Recon Module: Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crossing_the_Chasm/The_Journey_to_Haven)). Herex's actions are potentially left unnoticed up until the events of Operation Crimson Hammer, as acknowledgement by Seerus: `Who sent you infernal, iron assassins? Was it Herex? It matters not.` ([Operation Crimson Hammer - Engines of War - Seerus]()).

The validity of the Iron Law itself bing true or false is not yet questioned here, but rather it allows us to understand basic idea behind the governance.

Due to unknown nature of this plan, the validity of the claim, that Emberlight's existence could harm it, creates at least 2 interpretations, distinguished mainly by the degree of false information being distributed across non-Crimson Order gremlins, which, considering _general dystopian inspirations_, does seem as a potential assumption.

But, this could be also a case of unverifiable, unreliable information as Spiral Order is not familiar with gremlin's culture in details.

We also consider Herex's interpretation of Iron Law as broken to be truthful at least partially, as rooted in reality, rather than a complete delusion, [given latter eldritch horror motifs](#the-swarm).

With this, we can derive 2 general interpretation of the nature of Iron Law:

- Iron Law is a form of suppression of any state outside of Great Colony and distinct clans. Crimson Order considers Iron Law truthful while being unaware of its false nature, embodied by an implied relation of Herex and the Swarm.
- Iron Law is devised with the complete understanding of Cradle and Clockworks by the ruling party, Crimson Order and the king.

We will keep those 2 interpretations in mind while attempting to apply them to other elements of gremlin civilization in order to see how they would work in this framing.

There is one more conflicting interpretation of the term Great Colony, which we will hold off until the analysis of the [mending rune](#mending-rune-and-gremlin-emblem). Until then we will consider Great Colony as a literal location.

As we have not heard of gremlins in the context of other civilizations, we can make a plausible explanation for it being the fact that those periods of time _had happened prior to their incorporation into Cradle_. But it is unknown weather Cradle is as old as those civilizations - are Clockworks as old as, for example, heavenly kingdom or tortomega?

If gremlins are to be considered one of the more technologically advanced civilizations to date, on par with urban occult setting of devilites, [represented as Undercorp](), [heavenly kingdom of valkyries]() with [Owlite Academy](), and [Almire](), - gremlins, through Clockworks, had managed to connect all of the above civilization despite lingering existential threats within each epoch.

Based on the quote `Tinkinzar is said to be a great ruler and mechanical genius, responsible for the vision of the whole Clockworks` ([Bootshuze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Bootshuze#Dialogue)) we have to assume that Tinkinzar came before Clockworks and subsequently Cradle. Yet, it is due Pakrat's recount of events it is known that a many years had passed since one saw the king: `Tinkinzar not seen for many many years. Crimson Order carries out Tinkinzar's plans for Cradle` ([Pakrat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pakrat#Dialogue)).

Based on this information already we believe that either:

- Tinkinzar is far older than it might be expected of gremlin species. We have made such conclusion based on the phrasing Pakrat uses, as if Tinkinzar was still present in the past but after Pakrat was born.
- Tinkinzar is a fabricated figure, whose longevity or even immortality from before Cradle makes him close to a deific imperial figure within gremlins' Iron Law and Great Colony.

But, despite those differences, one element of those connections seems to us rather consistent - __Iron Law represents official gremlin ideology__.

##### Implied Time Periods

We will return to a different interpretation of the king within the analysis of Crimson Order, but currently, we have to consider this time discrepancy as a played straight argument in favour of our explanation of events of [Ghost in The Machine] and [unresolved ancient existence of laser technology in battlepods](), and subsequently, to first explanation of Tinkinzar as a real figure.

So, this idea of a assumed to be immortal king also ties in with a concept, first established during the [analysis of Ghost in The Machine danger mission](#ghosts-in-the-machine), - that Ironclaw Munitions Factory is the assembly line for not only Roarmulus Twins but other technology, specifically shock-themed lasers, the same ones present on Big Iron battlepod. [This battlepod secures the bridge of Isoran Vessel in the Iron Hulk](#ghosts-in-the-machine). This large time span is based of the fact the bodies of space jockeys to that point had turned to dust, haunting the space vessel, while gremlins had to contain in in the Dry Docks with their own machinery, primarily mecha knights.

##### Great Colony as an Imperial Colony

Then there is the name of Great Colony. Great Colony can be characterized as gremlin capital in a general sense, based of the known clans and depths, but disregarding a possibility of a greater scope entity, as none was currently presented. Considering the time spans we are working with, some evidence of gremlins' presence on Cradle had to be established from the very beginning of Clockworks construction, so the Great Colony must be one of the oldest developments.

We propose, that the name itself here suggests _that Great Colony is a literal colony, a colonial domain on a distant planet - that of Cradle,_ - meaning, that there exists a gremlin interstellar empire with a remote metropole, to which Great Colony had to belong, rather than a civilization relegated to single planet of Cradle.

As Great Colony is one of more significant locations of gremlin civilization on Cradle, and considering how ancient are Clockworks themselves, even taking in account that gremlins were implied to be assisted in its construction - `Some say the gremlins that you see working on it now are responsable. But that seems too great even for their seemingly infinite work force` ([Plinkop](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plinkop#Dialogue)), and `if we are to believe that indeed a lost kingdom from the past has somehow wound up in a massive mechanical world in present day, the question remains, why? its all a bit too convenient. But do gremlins really have this kind of power? I suspect something more than even what they are capable of engineering` ([Eye of the Needle - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Eye_of_the_Needle)), - Clockworks should have been present at least by the time Iron Hulk was haunted.

More so, as Isorans are already an interstellar species, their questions of gremlin technology (`Adapted from several unconventional Gremlin theories on physics, anyone unlucky enough to be dragged into this bomb's blast is in for a shock` - [Electron Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Bomb)) would make the latter in relation to Isorans even more advanced, allowing for the same if not greater degree of space travel.

Of course, there exists a possibility of Clockworks existing for thousands of years, which does seem more plausible, at lest if we only consider its scope being a planet, as then Strangers of Haven would not have any modern recounts of Clockworks beginnings: `"How old are the Clockworks?" - It is hard to know exactly as so much of what is within seems to hold their origin from different worlds. Some appear to be from realms of great antiquity, no doubt once home to innumerable old gods and creatures. This world is an unnatural one. What you see within it was never meant to be here. The great histories of so many worlds endlessly churning through the cogs of this great machine` ([Plinkop](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plinkop#Dialogue)). That is, if their responses are taken at face value, and with an assumption that Clockworks had not appeared in a few hundred years, even with an assistance of currently unknowns third party, as Plinkop's and Kora's dialogues suggest.

We could analyze the location of Great Colony in the same manner, as we had attempted to understand what purpose Dry Docks serve and the architecture of Owlite Academy. But here, it is not the location itself is important, but rather an understanding of what had happened before current hierarchy of clans was established.

##### A Precursor Planet Before Cradle

Considering the scale of Clockworks, as they comprise most likely most of all known volume of the planet, we assume, that some foundation for their construction, the raw materials, had to be gathered somewhere - be it a different planets or the one from which initially the construction began: `Within a seemingly impossible machine all manners of alien worlds exist within the giant globes that endlessly churn through every floor. What purpose do they serve? And from where did these worlds come? Before the crash the Skylark performed a partial scan of Cradle's surface that revealed what appeared to be a landscape composed of enormous parches of disparate terrain. The Clockworks are a manufactured place, perhaps the worlds they contain are harvested from the terrain above. But how?` ([Recon Module: Gloaming Wildwoods - Euclid](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Recon_Module:_Gloaming_Wildwoods)).

In the first case - `a landscape composed of enormous parches of disparate terrain`, we can appeal to the idea of many worlds being literally gathered, put together as Cradle, which may place Great Colony as the very first location of gremlin settlement.

The second case - `The Clockworks are a manufactured place, perhaps the worlds they contain are harvested from the terrain above`, can lead to Great Colony being also the first settlement, but within an environment of a single planet, that was harvested to build Clockworks form inside.

While those explanations have vague foundation based on the lack of information, they remove a dependency on an undisclosed planet, and at least, weave it into the general narrative, as the prior had to be incorporated into Cradle either way at some point in time under current chronology. Apart from this, the phrase: `The Clockworks are a manufactured place, perhaps the worlds they contain are harvested from the terrain above` seems to be too specific to be a speculation, rather than a plain guess, as most of those locations can be seen as completely unrelated.

But, due to prior 8 chapter, we are currently seeing __the idea of a single precursor planet, which had to encompass all of those civilizations, to be true.__

This planet had to contain most of the entities from the timeline: dragons, Owlites, Kats, kingdom of Ironmight and Almire. These include later discoveries of the Nameless Realm and Underworld. This proposal, then, would not conflict with epochs of kingdom of Almire. Despite a possibility of decoupling Almire's narrative and history from the rest, mainly from the origins of legion of Ur and the relation to heavenly kingdom of valkyries, mentioned forgotten time, it would not bring drastic changes to the timeline, as currently all of the Underworld-adjacent laws are not restricted by presence of the Core, apart from spirits returning to material realm.

#### Gremlin Physiology

As for gremlins, while the location of Great Colony remains unknown, we still can attempt to guess, what it was before any large-scale construction of Clockworks had begun:

- Considering gremlins of all known clans, - Tenderfoot, Ironclaw, Darkfang, and Grinchlins, - wear goggles, including those located in Emberlight, we can suggests that underground conditions had taken effect on gremlin physiology. Gremlins of Haven, such as Pakrat, Punch, and Vise, still wear similar uniform and have obscured muzzle with goggles or masks _reminiscent of Strangers' asymmetrical design._

    - There is a case of Crimson Order member, Seerus, as he lacks any explicitly advanced equipment, preferring a mask over goggles, through which his spiral eyes are seen. This, with ths general motif of Seerus being described as: `Taking on ol' Seerus aye? Careful now, he's not right in the head. Proper imbalanced that one. He and I go way back, but not in any way worth remembering` ([Operation Crimson Hammer - Lobby - Vise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vise)), seems as a design decision, rather than his status as a member of the Order.
    - In the same relation to goggles, - Darkfang gremlins and Ironclaw gremlins have different designs of goggle lenses, as the prior is round, while the latter has slitted design. Tenderfoot gremlins and gremlins of Haven, Pakrat specifically, also follow Ironclaw design pattern.

        Due to this, we propose, that the amount of sunlight has influenced this design. While there are artificial skydomes, a greater protection would be required from natural sunlight. And, as Darkfang clan inhabits the lowest Clockwork depth among major 3 clans, omitting Grinchlins, they would likely possess a less restricted field of view, as no natural light presents a danger.

        In this context, the events of [A Gremlin in Knead]() Emberlight cook, Groat's design expands on goggle's configurable design. As during the possession by [Dread Velvet](), Groat's goggles are identical to Darkfang gremlins', and after the possession, they obtain a slitted design, similar to Pakrat's. This can be connected to the possessor, as one disregarding Groat's physiology in order to perceive as much surrounding as possible.

- Presence of Sun and Moon plates within Clockworks' artificial sky of skydomes. The moon is identical to one on Cradle's orbit, as both have a characteristic spiral on the near side.

  The fact those are located within Clockwork skydomes does suggest that those locations are built to house biospheres, when compared to regular Clockwork tunnels. But, apart from budget restrictions of the game, why would both celestial bodies had to be presented as ones of Cradle's star system, with all of the moving machinery accompanying it?

  It is also within those skydomes gremlin facilities - the compounds, - are present on par with other stratums in archaeological sense, such as tortomega ruins across Aurora Isles in their different forms.

Based on those elements we can suggest that gremlins, as species, had to be either nocturnal or inhabiting planetary surface under natural conditions, - living below ground, as a cave-dwelling species. But then, presence of fur makes it an uncommon characteristic of such specie. It is also presence of a day-night cycle within the skydomes which would point to more natural conditions in the past, be it Cradle, a different planet, or gremlin homeworld, but one to allow gremlins to _consistently build artificial suns and moons, gliding on the inner wall of skydomes_.

Given the fact gremlin compounds, a term for the military facilities, are located in those skydomes, seems to indicate their trait of goggles as a later measure from potentially generational effects of living underground. Due to this, we will now discuss entirety of known gremlin facilities.

#### Gremlin Military-Industrial Complex

As compounds are considered smaller gremlin facilities within skydomes, we have to address the more general notions, inspirations, and motifs of modern-day gremlin civilization.

Throughout the rank missions and the Arcade, several gremlin facilities are encountered, those are predominantly compounds, located within biospheres of skydomes, and rank-mission exclusive underground complexes. The latter, such as Camp Crimson, complex 357, and Grand Arsenal, share the same defense measures, such as _barbed wire_, _anti-tank concrete blocks_, likely serving the same purpose as _dragon's teeth_, and _anti-tank hedgehogs_.

Apart from those structure there are _production centers_ and _research facilities_, from which Ironclaw Munitions Factory and compound 42 stand out as the largest and well known.

We also have at least 2 types of numbered facilities: compounds and complexes. Their ownership within clans and members of Crimson Order remains vague, but will be analyzed further.

##### Mecha Knight Factories

One of more characteristic elements of gremlins was their skillful creation of constructs, such as battlepods, mecha knights, and gun puppies. We will return to gun puppies' designs later, as they were already present as creations of tortomega but now we will focus on mecha knights.

One of such factories is found during [Toy Soldiers mission](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toy_Soldiers): `Recon Knights ... have discovered a mecha knight production facility close to Haven. Mecha Knights are believed to be gremlin-engineered sentries of the construct family that share many of the capabilities of a Spiral Knight`. This factory, as suggested by the layout of [Factory Floor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toy_Soldiers#Gate_Map), is located within Clockwork tunnels outside of skydomes. Deeper into the factory the [Production Center](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toy_Soldiers/Production_Center) itself is located.

The production center is represented by the battlepod surrounded by a hexagonal shield. As this shielding pattern is also present on modified Proto Shields:

- `A Proto Shield modified to provide some protection against fire` ([Emberbreak Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Emberbreak_Shield)).
- `A Proto Shield modified to provide some protection against shock` ([Circuit Breaker Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Circuit_Breaker_Shield)).
- `A Proto Shield modified to provide some protection against freeze` ([Frostbreaker Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frostbreaker_Shield)).

We can assume this technology is understandable enough to be either adapted by Spiral Order, as they upgrade the Proto Shield with Clockwork material (`A small shield issued to all Spiral Knights recruits` - [Proto Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Proto_Shield)), or is a common representation of general protection to be created separate from gremlins'.

Given items such as [Circuit Breaker Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Circuit_Breaker_Armor) - `Armor with a hacked elemental core aimed at resisting shock. However, this non-standard modification creates other elemental weaknesses`, we consider the scenario of this shielding technology to be common among both Spiral Order and gremlins without its direct adaptation in the same manner as indestructible shields.

##### Heavy Weapons Facility: Sparkcaster and Sputterspark

The Heavy Weapons Facility is found during [Shocking Sentinel Sentries mission](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shocking_Sentient_Sentries) and is described as: `a secret weapons facility that according to the intel ..., could belong to a high ranking gremlin of The Crimson Order. It is heavily fortified by a small army of electrified constructs ... While it is unclear if this weapons stash actually belongs to a gremlin of The Crimson Order, it is no less worth infiltrating and neutralizing the weapons stash` ([Shocking Sentinel Sentries](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shocking_Sentient_Sentries)). The fact of its belonging is later confirmed by the dialogue between [Sputterspark](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sputterspark) and warmaster Seerus of Crimson Order within the final floor of the facility: `The Sparkcaster Deluxe is almost stable, I promise. I need a little more time, Warmaster. ... It looks like time has run out, Sputterspark. You'd better hope your little toy works` ([Sputterspark and Seerus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shocking_Sentient_Sentries/Heavy_Weapons_Facility)).

The facility itself houses a stationary device referred to a Sparkcaster, whose purpose, judging by the second encounter during [The Great Escape](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Great_Escape) in the prison [yard](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Great_Escape/The_Yard), is to hinder enemy movement on the frontlines by remote generation of artificial lightning from the rear.

Considering that the facility is marked as secret, it is plausible that Sparkcaster is of the same purpose as compound 42 of Herex of Crimson Order: `Production of Compound 42 is to cease immediately. While a formidable poison and no doubt useful in achieving a... 'higher' power amongst the Order, it seems to have formed an intelligence well beyond the scope of a standard bio-toxin` ([Compound 42 - Containment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42/Containment)), - that of Crimson Order member's secret research facility.

The second iteration of the device is labelled as Sparkcaster 9000 Deluxe. Considering that it is stated as a `triumph in gremlin engineering` ([The Great Escape - The Yard - Sputterspark](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Great_Escape/The_Yard)), we may read it in 2 ways: a comical hyperbole for the narrative and an actual analysis of the device with all of known laws of physic in mind.

As we are analyzing and connecting everything, we will go with the latter option. Specifically, the sole act of the device casting relatively controlled lightning is deeply related to the principles underlying Clockwork Power Complexes and [other instances of summoning lightning](). We will return to Sparkcaster in that section later. But as far as the themes and contextual framing of Sparkcaster allows, we believe, it would not be a logical leap to suggest an inspiration from _20th century wonder-weapons_.

##### Test Labs

One of testing laboratories was found to contain schematics for Roarmulus Twins, or at that point in time, known only as Project R during the events of [Plan of Attack](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plan_of_Attack): `Deep within a toxic cavern lies a hidden test lab that gremlins have been using as a testing ground for components of Project R. One of these components still in development is reported to have schematics for the project close by` ([Plan of Attack](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plan_of_Attack)).

##### Trap Chambers

Trap chamber is introduced in [Faith in Armor mission](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Faith_in_Armor): `An apprentice named Wilks who had just arrived from a Rescue Camp has found himself in what Spiral HQ calls a 'Trap Chamber.' These levels of most likely gremlin design seem to be specifically built to trap and ultimately eliminate those attempting to explore the Clockworks`.

The [trap chamber](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Faith_in_Armor/The_Trap_Chamber) itself consists of several enclosed structures, connected by bridges.

##### Weapon Caches, Factories, and Munition Storages

Mission [Sewer Stash](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sewer_Stash) establishes existence of weapon caches across Clockworks: `Intel suggests that once manufactured, weapons are moved out of the Ironclaw Munitions Factory and stored in secret weapon caches throughout the Clockworks. One of these caches has been uncovered in one of the Clockwork's wasteworks systems` ([Sewer Stash](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sewer_Stash)). That weapon cache contains instances of battlepods.

A decommissioned type of similar munitions storages and factories is explored through [Assault on Machine Shop 13](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Assault_on_Machine_Shop_13) mission - `decommissioned gremlin weapons factories that are still actively bustling with hostile constructs, and in some cases are even stocked with operational, active war machines`, proving presence of factories across varying terrain.

##### Crimson Order Hideouts

Existence of Crimson Order hideouts is established during the events of [Spark and Roar](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spark_and_Roar): `An exceptionally high concentration of constructs has been found guarding an area of the Clockworks that Spiral HQ suspects could be a Crimson Order hideout`.

A [Hidden Hideout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spark_and_Roar/Hidden_Hideout) presents itself as one belonging to Herex, but the ownership and its state are not important currently, but rather its location. Before actual facility around the hideout found in [The Bitter Battle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spark_and_Roar/The_Bitter_Battle), knights had to traverse a [march](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spark_and_Roar#Gate_Map) and [tundra](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spark_and_Roar#Gate_Map), referred as Cold March and Iron Tundra.

While Iron Tundra is a deconstruction zone and Cold March is a compound, we have to consider general theme of the hideout being a small facility of a member of Crimson Order deep in the frozen location, potentially in proximity to arctic circle, or, given context of Clockworks, [Cooling Chambers'](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cooling_Chamber) effects onto the surroundings.

The arena, [The Bitter Battle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spark_and_Roar/The_Bitter_Battle) depth suggests it being a proper road to the hideout itself, as it is built from a series of gates, connected by a single road. Notably, it is the last gateway, which has blown open fenced gates and blaring alarms.

The hideout proper in its design suggests it being personal quarters in case of emergency. The [size](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Hidden_Hideout.jpg) of the hideout is also of interest to us, containing a few points of interest:

- A yard with a Crimson Order insignia.
- Workstation with vials and an recon module.
- Entrance and exit elevators connected to the system of Clockwork gates.
- The cisterns and the main structural body behind the exit elevator. The location's design itself resembles gremlin town of [Emberlight](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Emberlight), that is the hull of what is considered Clockwork tunnels is habitable and likely contains proper living quarters, which would suffice a few gremlins for a limited time, as it is first and foremost a hideout.

We also propose, that it is potentially a bunker, considering the metal beam extending upwards, suggesting a reinforced structure, similar to the deepest location of [Ironclaw Munitions Factory]().

##### Compound 42 and Slime Generators

As for the rest of military research facilities, there is compound 42, which specializes in production of bioweapons. It is described as: `a gremlin bioweapons facility deep within the Clockworks. It is believed that this facility belongs to a member of the Crimson Order known only as Herex. The Recon Rangers have been tasked with infiltrating the facility and uncovering the nature of Herex's bioweapons before they are put to use` ([Compound 42](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42)).

When it is infiltrated, it is discovered that Herex had already ordered to burn it, removing all of evidence of its existence: `Production of Compound 42 is to cease immediately. While a formidable poison and no doubt useful in achieving a... 'higher' power amongst the Order, it seems to have formed an intelligence well beyond the scope of a standard bio-toxin. All traces of Compound 42 should be eliminated, along with the facility and any engineers not part of the inner fold. Remind the scorchers who find these orders uncomfortable that those who disobey shall soon hear my whisper in their ears. Seal the doors and burn everything to the ground` ([Compound 42 - Containment - Secret Memo - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42/Containment)). The poison with intelligence of standard bio-toxin question are the [toxoils](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxoil).

The facility contains large storage tubes of green gel. Based on the quote `it seems to have formed an intelligence well beyond the scope of a standard bio-toxin` ([Compound 42 - Containment - Secret Memo - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42/Containment)), we can make a working assumption that this gel content is the bio-toxin. But, this puts in question a natural origin of [toxoilers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxigel#Toxoil) and [toxigels](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxigel#Toxigel). Regular [toxigels](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxigel#Toxigel) and then oilers are both also found across locations, which does not seem to be connected to the compound.

At the last arena of the [containment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42/Containment) 6 large tubes of orange gel are found in the end of the structure, several of which are seen to be leaking. We suggest those are the basis for oilers in order to produce what became toxoils. There are also 3 large leaking tubes of green gel on the west side of the structure, toxic gel, comprising toxigels.

During the event of [Vile Engine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine) mission lichens were also involved: `Somewhere below a level that lichens have taken to inhabiting lies a strange facility of unknown origin that seems to be used for the production of toxic slime monsters. The 'slime generators' are capable of rapidly producing slime monsters that then quickly populate nearby levels. Squads in neighboring levels have already reported overwhelming numbers of toxic slimes, making it impossible to lead expeditions beyond depth 23. It is time ... to infiltrate this strange facility and shut down production of these vile creatures. Any data that you could collect as their origin would be highly valuable to Spiral HQ` ([Vile Engine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine)). The generators are presented in the [Processing Plant](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine/Processing_Plant) as 2 battlepods creating not toxic, but [quicksilver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Quicksilver) lichens.

Considering past knowledge of Herex specializing in bioweapons, involving accidental creation or mutation of lichens in compound 42, an assumption could be made that this facility does also relate to Herex. Yet, this inconsistency of the [processing plant](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine/Processing_Plant) itself will be kept in mind for the analysis of quicksilver lichens.

##### Chemical Plants

Existence of chemical plants is presented in the mission - [The Phantom Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Phantom_Mask):`Rhendon is waiting for you in an abandoned gremlin chemical plant where reconnaissance has located a cache of missing battle sprites. Secure the sprites and clear the area of hostiles. You are authorized to use any sprites you secure in order to complete the mission`.

##### Maskeraith, Sunset Steppes, and Haven Mines

This location is of particular interest to us duw to being one where [Maskeraith battle sprites are recovered](#maskeraith).

The other notion, which was not covered in relation to Maskeraith's analysis is their location. As Seraphynxs were found to continue Kat Tribe's deed, we are left with Drakons and Maskeraith.

With the current framework, we propose, that Drakons have specifically settled in [Sunset Steppes](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sunset_Steppes), as this area was also part of dragons' descendants - tortomega, specifically the part of larger shattered landmass of tortomega homeland.

As for Maskeraith, they are found hear the pile of bones within the facility. The facility itself in its design is similar to the Haven Mines, which are visited in Lockdown mode - with Clockwork tunnels being placed within the overgrown stone interior. And, as the facility is referred to as the [Creeping Cavern](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Phantom_Mask/Creeping_Cavern), we can confirm, that the mines are also a subterranean location.

It is then the relation between poison, chemicals and undeath which is established here.

We have previously covered a supernatural/Underworld-related element both of frost, manifested as [Everfrost]() with its plots, and poison, as a hypothetical [Vile deity]() and themes of [Plague Essence](). As far as analysis goes, we can suspect a vague, but greater relation to Underworld.

As for the patterns within gremlin facilities, we can draw parallels to a different facility found during a [Plan of Attack](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plan_of_Attack), as this facility is also found within a toxic cavern: `Deep within a toxic cavern lies a hidden test lab that gremlins have been using as a testing ground for components of Project R. One of these components still in development is reported to have schematics for the project close by` ([Plan of Attack](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plan_of_Attack)).

With this we can establish, based specifically on the descriptions, that a significant portion of Cradle has remained as-is - to be made of rock, - whose caverns were repurposed for, potentially, higher secrecy facilities.

##### Camp Crimson

Depth of [Camp Crimson](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Collector/Camp_Crimson) is one of 2 known facilities of a distinct design. While Camp Crimson is not seen from the outside, the other location, - complex 357, - was.

The camp within a proximity of an entrance, contains what seems to be rail tracks for the transportation vessels, resembling _armored trains_. Those vessels are armed with an artillery canons on the their roofs and contain barred cells within the hull. The entrance to the facility is characterized by a few bridging railroads through the gates into the proper facility.

The same cells are observed all across the camp, with a few placed within the metal scaffolding-like structures above and below the depth of a camp. The rails are also found leading up and into the fortified perimeter of [Grand Arsenal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Arsenal), and seen multiple times within it, spanning across the facility.

Entirety of the camp's site is structured as a highly secured location, with search lights, armored watchtowers, and barbed wire. Apart from those, a peculiar element of metal pillars is seen across the camp, explicitly noticeable near the exit elevator, with several metal pillars extending upwards with widespread usage of Crimson Order insignia. All of those designs are present both across Camp Crimson and later discussed complex 357.

It is unknown weather camps as such had operated solely as prisons, or were of worse purpose. Yet, as knights had arrived relatively recently, we can suggest that those structures were built within the context of clan and Crimson Order members' inner conflicts.

Then there are events of [Great Escape](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Great_Escape): `Recon Knights have collected intel that has revealed the gremlin 'Crimson Order' has begun ordering gremlins to build makeshift prisons within the Clockworks where Spiral Knights are being taken and imprisoned. It is believed that these orders are coming in direct response to your destruction of the Roarmulus Twins. Further data suggests that these makeshift prisons are a temporary solution until a larger facility can be built. Spiral HQ however has no intention of these imprisoned knights staying long enough to find out`. The fact that this solution is suggested to be a temporary one, we can make a guess, that the earlier question regarding the purpose of Camp Crimson as a facility not restricted to an imprisonment, is probable.

##### Complex 357

Found at the end of [Crimson Chaos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crimson_Chaos), [Complex 357](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crimson_Chaos/Complex_357) is a highly guarded facility, and the only one across rank missions, whose surface entrance is explicitly presented.

While located within a gremlin compound within a skydome, the main building of the facility - its entrance specifically, - is very distinct by its design, most reminiscent of an _imperial style_:

- Its inner yard has a wide inclined ascent to the entrance.
- To the sides of the main road, patches of grass with trees, gun puppy statues, as ones found across the grounds of tortomega civilization are found.
- Largest to date amount of battlepods at the entrance is found. Contrasting to Grand Arsenal, those seem to serve as a defense measure of the facility.
- Crimson Order tapestry is seen on the armored front of the facility.

The gate icon of the inner facility, - the underground complex itself labeled 357, - is of the same image of a rocket utilized to mark depths, identified as the Ironclaw Munitions Factory. Weather this complex is a research or a production facility is unknown.

##### Herex's Infiltration of Complex 357

The contents of the facility - __the schematics__, - were crucial enough for Herex to infiltrate it prior to his actions regarding Crimson Order and intent to descend into the Core, as suggested by the recon module: `Infiltrate the Complex. Take all schematics. The Nine are quite but we will silence them. The Knights persue but we will halt them. Only Herex comprehends the Truth. Only Herex will descend. There can be no other` ([Crimson Chaos - Complex 357 - Recon Module: Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Complex_357)). At that point we do not know the _purpose of those schematics nor their contents_.

The facility itself contains only poison-themed constructs, alluding to Herex's poison motif. We believe, it is a no less important matter of discussion, weather the facility belongs to Herex. There are a few issues with identification of those constructs.

To start off, it is due to the fact Spiral Order was monitoring the facility prior to it going silent.

The complex is described in the [Crimson Chaos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crimson_Chaos) as follows: `Spiral HQ has been monitoring several known Crimson Order bases in hopes of intercepting one of their elusive high-ranking members. Recon knights assigned to watch one of those bases report that it has suddenly gone silent and have requested backup before investigating it further`. Then, a recon soldier bear the entrance elevator to the complex 357 reports: `We've been monitoring the base for weeks then it went silent. Quite suddenly. We're not sure what you're going to find down there. Our sensors show no active life forms`.

This suggests, that the events, identified as Herex's infiltration, had to transpire without any evidence of those happening at least on the surface of the facility. There are damaged battlepods, but we don't have enough information to suggest, that those were a result of an infiltration, although we believe it is likely, given general state of the facility.

While a speculation, the fact that 2 Ghostmane Stalkers are found at the end of the complex may imply, that the technology Spiral Order uses to detect lifeforms, does not work on camouflaged Stalkers.

###### Haven Lab Infiltration

But, there is another instance of Spiral Order detecting significant gremlin activity - during the events of A New Threat and the Collector:

- `And speaking of gremlins, we're starting to get an alarming number of reports of gremlins mobilizing in the Clockworks below Haven. We don't have too many details yet, but given the relations we've had with them so far, our guess is they're preparing for an attack` ([A New Threat - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_New_Threat/Lobby)).
- `One moment everything was fine and the next thing we know gremlins are bursting out of the ground` ([Morlin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_New_Threat/Lobby)).
- `They burst out of the ground all around us...` ([The Collector - Camp Crimson - Nameless knight right of the Veteran Knight](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Collector/Camp_Crimson)).

This, we believe, establishes a notion, - that of __gremlins' strategy of infiltrating enemy facilities by traversing Clockwork Tunnels below__. As the events of the attack on the Laboratory, Herex is familiar with such approach.

As Spiral Order hadn't discovered any sudden activity, it may be interpreted in 2 ways:

- The facility had already contained poison-themes constructs.
- While the facility was monitored, the infiltration had taken place with poison-themed constructs being remnants of the infiltration, being outsiders to the facility.

Given sudden decline in facility's activity, we can only image how it had happened only based on the events of [A New Threat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_New_Threat) mission. [A New Threat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_New_Threat) is the only direct instance of Herex's plan being witnessed prior to Swarm's explicit involvement - of an sudden assault performed through underlying Clockwork tunnels of Haven Lab.

If we attempt to extrapolate this strategy onto the complex, we can resolve the issue of a transportation of a squad of constructs into the facility under the logic of those belonging to Herex. But, compared to the New Threat, in Crimson Chaos we find constructs rather than living gremlins. And, small army of constructs is found in the Shadowplay's version of Firestorm Citadel, wherein those constructs had to be transported across the same route the knight would take, as more gremlin technology is found in the northern part of the Court.

So far it seems that constructs belong to Herex, based on other his appearances and themes.

###### Inner Fold of Compound 42

It is also here we may identify gremlins accompanying Herex in Shadowplay. Herex is seen to hide his true motivations: `All traces of Compound 42 should be eliminated, along with the facility and any engineers not part of the inner fold. Remind the scorchers who find these orders uncomfortable that those who disobey shall soon hear my whisper in their ears. Seal the doors and burn everything to the ground` ([Compound 42 - Containment - Secret Memo: Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Containment)).

Inner fold gremlins, given group's name, seem to be relatively trusted members close to Herex. Those would be likely loyal to Herex and his plans regarding Cradle and the Core. Given this reasoning, we propose, that are the [same gremlins found in the Throne Room of Shadowplay](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Throne_Room).

###### Iron Assassins and Ghostmane Stalkers

The other instance of Herex's strategizing may be seen in the events of Operation Crimson Hammer, wherein Seerus explicitly suggests Spiral Order being under the command of Herex: `Who sent you infernal, iron assassins? Was it Herex? It matters not.` ([Operation Crimson Hammer - Engines of War - Seerus]())

While Seerus also has under his command gremlin stalkers, the Knights being referred as assassins may hint at Ghostmane Stalkers being primary unit through which Herex executes his undercover operations.

More so, earlier mention of `Remind the scorchers who find these orders uncomfortable that those who disobey shall soon hear my whisper in their ears. Seal the doors and burn everything to the ground` ([Compound 42 - Containment - Secret Memo: Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Containment)) may also hint, that it is not him directly hunting for individuals which might have seemed so given his true opposition to Crimson Order, but rather those are Stalkers which operate on his behalf.

Presence of Ghostmane Stalkers in the complex seems us as further proof of those being Herex's primary force in undercover operations.

###### Development of Herex's Scheme

Given events of Operation Crimson Hammer, we may assume, that by the time of that mission Crimson Order or at least Seerus is already aware of Herex's plans as ones opposing Crimson Order, which is drastically opposite to initial preparation prior to retrieval of the Artifact in [The Ancient Generator](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Ancient_Generator): `Schemer Razwog: Work away from the others. The Order must never know we have the artifact. Find a way to power it. Bring it to me. Do not betray me. I will know` ([Crossing the Chasm - The Journey to Haven - Recon Module: Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crossing_the_Chasm/The_Journey_to_Haven)).

Entirety of Crimson Order facility - complex 357, - was slaughtered, seem to be a change Herex's strategy to more direct confrontation with Crimson Order, as also suggested by the recon module: `The Nine are quite but we will silence them. The Knights persue but we will halt them. Only Herex comprehends the Truth. Only Herex will descend. There can be no other` ([Crimson Chaos - Complex 357 - Recon Module: Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Complex_357)).

This narrative seem to also fit with Spiral Order, as it seem to arrive near earlier beginnings of Herex's execution of his plan. And, due to this parity, both Herex and Spiral Order in relation to Grand Arsenal from Seerus's perspective would seem to fit into the narrative of a direct armed confrontation.

###### Ownership and Contents of Complex 357

With aforementioned notions considered, we must analyze the state of the complex itself. The complex lacks any visual signs of being Crimson Order facility apart from a few monitors depicting its insignia. This is important in terms of consistency, as other signs affirming facility's ownership tend to exist.

We have previously seen Herex's compound 42 and Crimson Order hideout containing _Crimson Order insignia of green hue_, specifically, the [final arena of Containment of Compound 42](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42/Containment), and [Hidden Hideout of Spark and Roar](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hidden_Hideout). As such design pattern in absent in complex 357, we may assume that _complex 357 does not belong to Herex_.

Yet, this approach does not expand on presence of constructs:

- While mobile constructs - such as elite mecha-knights could be explained through the logic of them arriving from the tunnels, gun puppies are usually seen to emerge from the floors through hatches.
- Gun puppies are found at the main entrance road after the side bridge of the underground facility's elevator, and 2 more are found at respawn pads _behind the sandbag barricade guarding the gates of innermost facility_.

    During Shadowplay, [Sick Puppies](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sick_Puppy#Sick_Puppy) are also present, which may hint at their mobility, but would not explain aforementioned placement as defensive one.

- There are 2 elite [poison knight](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Poison_Knight#Poison_Knight) respawn pads by the sides of central battlepod in the final arena of the complex.

    We will return to this pattern in the context of Ironclaw Munitions factory, but here it is notable to establish a patten of a battlepod surrounded by respawn pads of elite constructs. By that we refer to [production center](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Production_Center) of [Toy Soldiers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toy_Soldiers) mission. But, compared to production center, given a path to an elevator and potential location of schematics behind the battlepod, it is unlikely that it serves as a primary operational element of the facility, but rather its inner yard.

The central entrance of 9 tiles width to the first gatehouse surrounded by 2 armored watchtowers and accompanied by metal pillars on the sides, is severely damaged. The part of the bridge is blown off, and the part leading up the the gates has signs of bombardment or other force to be able to cause elongated gaps. This degree of damage could not be done by sole actions of Herex, if he was present, and Stalkers. But, it can be achieved, if we consider that both Mortafires and Demos are present during Shadowplay - as those are ones present in Deconstruction Zones, which, by design, are in a process of deconstruction. Considering the potential of [Mortafires' heavy infantry rockets](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mortafire) and [Demos' explosives](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Demo), this seems as a plausible explanation.

Throughout entirety of the facility there are many instances of fortifications from concrete blocks to barbed wire and anti-tank hedgehogs. Without demolishing those it'll be impossible to proceed deeper into the facility. Near the entrance to the courtyard, protected by 2 gates, several corpses are found.

Then, the facility is also filled with mineral rocks, which also hinder the movement deeper into the complex. Based on their different coloration, most distinctly seen on the eastern side of the complex, the _rocks are most likely made of the same minerals, as Moonstone, Dark Matter, Valestone, etc._ The Knight is required to clear those up in order to reach the end of the facility - we will keep this in mind.

###### Locations of The Schematics

Apart the above elements, there are several distinct rooms with more research-and-development-oriented design, with vials, clipboards and torn pages.

Those seem to us to be _the exact locations containing the schematics_:

- East of the front gates there is a room with a gold key, secured by 5 gates, activated by buttons, hidden among minerals. The room has a single [gun block](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Gun_Block.png) and a target, with 1 gremlin corpse and multiple torn pages on the floor, 2 clips, and multiple monitors depicting static.
- West of the front gates a room contains 2 cisterns, purple and green tubes of gel, monitors, a few smaller vials, 1 clip and a gremlin corpse with a few torn pages on the floor surrounding it.

    Notably, west of the entrance to the room a pool of gel and valestone is seen pumped out of a small pipe - [a specific design patten we will later identify as one of grinded minerals]().

    Norse of the most-west section with rocket blocks, a single tube of green liquid is located and few luminite minerals are found below it among a pair of 2 gears.
- The final room is located north of the complex, beyond the battlepod. There are also torn pages, several monitors, 2 clips, monitors with static, and, notably, several large books: as one is opened at the table, a tome, and what is supposedly a bookshelf, with a single gremlin corpse nearby.

Judging by that, it seems that the infiltration was sudden

Given all of those properties within the complex, from its gate icon to contents and context, we propose _Complex 357 being a multi-purposed research facility_ belonging to a different member of Crimson Order, which had utilized poison-themed constructs in its defenses.

But, we still do not know the contents of those schematics nor their purpose. We will return to those ones we cover the majority of the facilities on Cradle.

##### Cradle Defenses

Cradle weapons are encountered directly during intro cinematic, as were used on Skylark as well as potentially mentioned by Parma in the Refuge: `Once, the gremlins were in charge of maintaining Cradle's defenses. But they had their own plans` ([Dreams and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Refuge)).

Judging by the footage, the beams had originated from the exposed Clockworks' segments from 3 sources. The beams themselves are most reminiscent of lasers utilized by the battlepods of Grand Arsenal and Big Iron, as well as incorporated into Roarmulus Twins. A key difference here is the fact _those lasers are purple_. It can be explained by an application of shadow damage, which seems as both most plausible and single explanation.

Usage of shadow damage is not novel for gremlins, as they did utilize it, although in lesser amounts, _mostly attributed to the members of Crimson Order_, such as Seerus and his devices bombs - [Dark Retribution](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Retribution) alchemy tree: `The perfected version of the shadowy bomb that Warmaster Seerus engineered with the sole purpose of eliminating other gremlins that stood in his way. It is thought to have been reserved for use against other members of the Crimson Order` ([Dark Retribution](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Retribution)). So the usage of it for the planetary defenses seems as likely explanation, considering that shadow damage is known to be dangerous both to gremlins and lichens.

##### The Collector

The Collector is described as follows: `There have been reports of a large, mechanical entity we have named the 'Collector' who has been intercepting our knights and taking both them and the sprites they were tracking and imprisoning them in a well-guarded compound deep within the Clockworks. Armed with your new sprite, your mission is to find this 'Collector' and rescue the knights and the sprites it has taken captive` ([The Collector](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Collector)).

Based on the analysis of Camp Crimson we came to conclusion, that the camp itself was established prior to arrival of Spiral Order, and, due to ability to capture Knights and Sprites by the Collector, we propose that its previous function was to capture gremlins at least.

Apart from this, it is likely that it had also served as an elite unit across constructs such as mecha knights by the fact of having similar design of wrenches in place of limbs and great offensive capabilities.

One of greater importance elements of its arsenal is the large charged explosion. This is the key element to a larger motif which will be then analyzed across gremlin technology. The explosion in both instances of the Collector - within the camp and at the [Overworks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Breaking_in_the_Recruits/The_Overworks), - deals split shadow and normal damage, its only shadow damaging attack - _uncharacteristic of any other construct_. Moreover, the __explosion has an antique evil eye__ to appear, the same _observed across Electron and Graviton bombs design_. Considering this, a white painted evil eye of the same antique design with the Collector's eye meant to be an iris seems as an intentional design choice, which also points to its explosive shadow damage attack.

Apart from it, a different relation to curse arises here.

Lord Vanaduke, when he has no mask, has red and orange arcs of lightning around him. Those lightnings are the same as the collector. Moreover, Arkus also in his later stages of the fight has lightning arcs present in the same pattern, although of purple color, same as Darkfire Lord Vanaduke unmasked.

We suggest that this is a design pattern. If it would not be for the evil eye, this would not be a reason for an analysis of the latter. But, as the theme of curse in its different forms is consistent here, we propose that it serves as an argument for the _Collector being constructed utilizing far more advanced technology_, involving Underworld and application of shadow damage through the common pattern of an eye.

We were to develop this idea further, of Collector being an elite construct unit, application of shadow damage may be specifically devised to target other gremlins on a larger scale of entire battlefield, reminiscent of [Seerus's Dark Retribution](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Retribution). This does not exactly mean, that the Collector was designed by Seerus, as there are other 7 members of Crimson Order left unknown, but it is a pattern nonetheless.

The COllector possess a system on the back which seems to contain a storage of bombs. While this function does not reveal much, the symbol on the backpack tells much more - it is an inverted emblem found on the [ghost blocks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghost_Block#Ghost_Block), which requires us to study the latter as we cover Clockworks themselves.

##### Electron Vortex

Electron vortex is an elemental counterpart of the Graviton bomb, but both have the same animation and presence of an antique evil eye of the same shape as the Collector. The case of the Collector - due to its explosion's design, we propose, is of the same nature as more likely electron bomb and less likely graviton bomb, yet, tapping into the powers of curse and Underworld.

But, due to descriptions of those bombs we believe they were invented in different period of time:

- `A small explosive charge with mysterious origins. It is capable of generating a vortex of crushing gravity` ([Graviton Charge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graviton_Charge)).
- `A Graviton Bomb fortified with potentially dangerous amounts of shadow steel. Its blast should draw your foes toward it... if it doesn't rip the entire universe in two, that is` ([Graviton Vortex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graviton_Vortex)).
- `A small electro-explosive charge with mysterious origins. It is capable of generating a crippling vortex of electricity` ([Electron Charge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Charge)).
- `Adapted from several unconventional Gremlin theories on physics, anyone unlucky enough to be dragged into this bomb's blast is in for a shock` ([Electron Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Bomb)).
- `An Electron Bomb modified with a payload of unstable organic essence. Foes caught in its punishing radius are cruelly referred to as "thunderstuck"` ([Electron Vortex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Vortex)). As it is stated to be `modified with a payload of unstable organic essence`, and by the fact of being a 5-star equipment, it has 1 additional material to its recipe - [Storm Chaser](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Chaser): `A rare elemental found hovering in storm clouds. Their electric hum creates an almost melodic choir that can be faintly heard between thunderclaps`, which seems to us as direct confirmation of the elemental being used in the transmutation process.

We propose an explanation. That is gremlins have invented [Electron Vortex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Vortex) based of the [Graviton Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graviton_Bomb) through introduction of their own tech, specifically related to electricity and shock, likely through application of [Storm Chasers](), as it is present in the recipe.

We will see [later, that entirety of Clockworks at the end operates on instances of more arcane or magic properties of an established setting](), heavily leaning into magitech.

As it is an elemental counterpart to Graviton Bomb, the reason for devilish material - [Forbidden Fruit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Forbidden_Fruit) specifically, had to be justified, which here, we suggest, is a common underlying motif. It can be argued that [Forbidden Fruit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Forbidden_Fruit) is also used transmute [Twisted Spine Cone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Twisted_Spine_Cone), but we have to remember that Snarbolax, whom this item is attributed to, [is related to curse and then Underworld]().

##### Gremlin Incinerators

Multiple [Gremlins incinerators](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlin_Incinerator#Gremlin_Incinerator) are found in the end of compound 42 have a unique design. Not only they are as large as Razwog, their masks seem to suggest a similar inspiration. Those masks differ from regular wielding masks by the fact of being less of a visor and more of an eye. Notably, the plate the red eye is located on, also is capable of moving across the height of helm's surface as it has a slot underneath, similar to Collector's design.

Considering those scorchers are an elite units implied to be under a command of Herex of Crimson Order, we can make an educated guess that the _Collector's design in the context of gremlin elite units is more common than it seems._

##### Grand Arsenal

One of a few elements worth mentioning within the Grand Arsenal are the railways extending from the frontiers of of the complex. While no transportation carts were seen across the operation, we can suggest at least 2 uses for them:

- As there are several holding cells within the facility, it can be argued that those were transported across the rails, but, their number is minimal, compared to one of Camp Crimson.
- A more likely explanation is those railways are designed to deliver ammunition from the complex. Grand Arsenal is the only place apart from Razwog's facility above power complex, wherein [unused rockets are rotated enough](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Unused_Rocket.png) for gremlin insignia to be visibly seen, rather than its stripes.

Then there are what seems to be conveyors for missiles found below the Grand Arsenal artillery - 2 lines of missiles extending from the chambers protected with red force fields. Those 2 lines then, passing through a wall of the facility end with vertical launching systems, as evident by both the metal beams and how those rockets react to being damaged - by launching upwards. Since it is essentially a fortified arsenal storage facility, we can gather that it is not the production lines, but only of delivery and transportation.

##### Crimson Throne and Aftermath

The other point of interest is located at the end of Grand Arsenal, in the innermost location only labeled as "Aftermath" during the operation. It is accessed from behind the wall of the main entrance of the Arsenal, wherein the arsenal itself is found, with Crimson Order tapestry hanging above. This part of facility is the only one with visible walls extending above the ground level, resembling lobbies of danger missions.

The location of Aftermath seems to be the briefing room of the facility or its command center. We suspect such usage by 2 designs:

- As due to its unique execution with Crimson Order throne present at its center surrounded by hulls or built inactive Roarmulus Twins.
- Apart from the throne, there are 3 distinct areas.

    On sides of the throne 6 monitors are present, which seem to contain an important data, as it is encrypted. One of the soldiers accompanying Feron comments on the gremlin cryptography: `It'll take forever to decipher gremlin cryptography` ([Operation Crimson Hammer - Aftermath - knight right of Feron]). We will revisit it later.

    The other area is located south of the throne, it is the one seen first, it also contains several non-interactive monitors.

By the sides of the throne room, there are 2 lines of storage, containing inactive and damaged Roarmulus Twins and battlepods. Weather those are manufactured within the facility is unknown, but, as suggested by existence of the Ironclaw Munitions Factory, it seems that the latter is responsible for the production, while Arsenal is mostly utilized for storage.

##### Ironclaw Munitions Factory

Ironclaw Munitions Factory presents a few novel concepts, as well as reaffirms several previous ones.

First, we must establish the scope of the analysis. We consider regular shock-themed factory and its Shadow Lairs' fire-themed variant both as canon from the perspective of layout, design, and contents.

With this in mind we will go through both iteration of the factory, starting from the shock-themed variant.

The factory is described as follows:

- `The Ironclaw Munitions Factory is a gremlin-operated weapons factory that specializes in the production of high-calibur explosives. Intel has revealed that it is developing a secret weapon known as 'Project Roarmulus' designed with the sole purpose of destroying Haven!` ([Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory)).

    The `high-calibur` term here is likely a slightly modified caliber.

- `Once known to Spiral HQ as 'Project R', the Roarmulus Twins have been identified as a gremlin-engineered weapon of tremendous power built with the sole purpose of destroying Haven. Stored deep within the heart of the Ironclaw Munitions Factory, this weapon is not only protected by hordes of shock-powered constructs and gremlins, but the factory is a highly dangerous, explosive hazard itself!` ([Built to Destroy!](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Built_to_Destroy!)).

    While this themes of powerful weapons is present both for Roarmulus Twins and Sparkcaster, and as both are engineered under command of Seerus, this further establishes a concrete theme of wonder-weapons, around which Seerus as a member of Crimson Order revolves.
- `After analyzing the schematics you recovered from the gremlin test lab, Spiral HQ know knows the nature of Project R as well as its location within a gremlin munitions facility. Spiral HQ is requesting that you enter this facility and destroy Project R before it can be used on Haven. Speak with Intel Agent Kora for full details` ([Target Acquired](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Target_Acquired)).
- `Project R appears to be in fact two massive weapons known as the 'Roarmulus Twins.' ... Designed by one of the Crimson Order itself, the Roarmulus Twins are some kind of construct cannon that the gremlins intend on moving up the Clockworks into the Haven Arcade! ... Based on what the schematics suggest, their power far exceeds standard gremlin weaponry and could be truly devastating to Haven, Spiral HQ and the strangers should it reach the Arcade. ... We have pinpointed its location to be in the deepest level of a gremlin facility known as the 'Ironclaw Munitions Factory.' The factory is used for the production of all manners of gremlin weaponry and is highly dangerous, even to the gremlins working there. ... There's one last thing- it seems you won't be the first knight to have entered the Ironclaw Munitions Factory. We've detected another Alpha Squad recon module somewhere within the factory` ([Target Acquired - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Target_Acquired)).

Based on the [earlier analysis of Big Iron battlepod lasers]() we had proposed that the factory itself is at least hundred years old due to presence of laser technology. It is most visible as being tested at the end of [Warfare Workshop](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory/Warfare_Workshop), as testing targets are placed against the canons.

###### Entrance and Abandoned Assembly

The deteriorated state of the [abandoned assembly](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Abandoned_Assembly) as its name suggest an event or a series of events which had led up to structural damage and abandonment while the facility itself had remained operational, evident by the ongoing production of weapons - being the Roarmulus Twins' components, - and later change from electric weaponry to fire-focused ones.

We can also draw parallels with the state complex 357 is found in, due to both having the same gate icon of the production facility and seemingly abandoned state.

In this context, while Herex, we believe, is not involved with the state of munitions factory, it suggests a _strategic value of complex 357_, implied by the importance of the schematics' retrieval.

Entrance to the factory, same as complex 357, is also particularly distinct. The entrance has an 11 tile width road, with an entrance of 4 tiles with distinct walls, reminiscent of the Royal Jelly Palace, Firestorm Citadel, or Grand Arsenal.

On the side of the main entrance road there are 6 structure support beams with the foundations of Clockworks' design. Several roads, leading up to the entrance, apart from the upper depth elevator, are blown off, with significant structural damage to the road itself.

This design reminds us of Herex's hideout, and its above-ground structure, traversed in the [Bitter Battle](), where in the leftmost road around a hull of the facility is broken.

Once inside the walls, the factory separates into 2 wings, both of which contain several instances of Project R components, all of which were depicted on the [Roarmulus Blueprints](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Roarmulus_Blueprints). Apart from it several deign choices are found in the eastern wing which seem to suggest those being conveyor belts.

###### Warfare Workshop

Within the Warfare Workshop another feature of the factory becomes more consistent, which was also present on previous depth - pools of [quicksilver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lichen#Quicksilver) slime. Those are reminiscent of previously discussed compound 42's likely artificially created [toxoils](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lichen#Toxoil). We will [return to the nature of Quicksilvers]() in the [analysis of the Jelly Kingdom]().

As for Workshop's layout, it has a central hall, separated from the machinery on the sides separated with walls, and during infiltration it is notable that western wing was not visited, although the path their remains intact.

It is the left wing which allows to understand approximate size of the facility, with the same design of 3 spaciously places support pillars as those found near the entrance hall of the facility, and eastern wall being a support or scaffolding structure.

It is also in the western wing an internal components of the Roarmulus twin are seen. In the end of the facility's floor and to the west testing grounds for laser cannons are present.

###### Bottom of the Factory

In the final depth of the facility, which is also described as its deepest point (`Stored deep within the heart of the Ironclaw Munitions Factory` - [Built to Destroy!](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Built_to_Destroy!), `We have pinpointed its location to be in the deepest level of a gremlin facility known as the 'Ironclaw Munitions Factory'` - [Target Acquired - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Target_Acquired)) the same large structure beams are consistently placed in relatively large amount, as in previously discussed Herex's [hideout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hidden_Hideout). We believe, those serve the same purpose, as they are present in the deepest points of both locations, they also mark it as, seemingly most secure, as conveyed by the design choice of those beams being placed in the first place.

If the entire plot of Project R is taken in consideration with the context of the factory being at that level of maintenance, we can make a guess that _the gremlin society is long past its prime._

#### Gremlin Weapons' Magic Motifs

Now, there are not many elemental gremlin weapons in a sense closer to Owlites, as they had directly utilized elemental materials, relating back to the discussion of Owlite academy and Valkyrian armors. This is a prelude to an analysis of underlying magitech themes of Clockworks and gremlin technology, and here we would like to look at the final designs and draw parallels to other similar instances.

Considering 2 following aspects:

- Shadow Ironclaw Munitions Factory only recently into the supposed timeline has started to produce fire-themed weapons, finalizing in, by far, more hazardous designs of Red Roarmulus Twins.

    With this, we observe in Red Roarmulus Twins a design, __uncharacteristic of any gremlin technology__, even other fire-themed ones. In relation to this _Vog-like design of Red Roarmulus Twins_ only tier 3 elemental gun puppies reach, but they are predominantly stone-like in texture and carvings, when compared to their normal-damage counterparts.

- Shadow weapons, on the other hand, are kept to upper classes of gremlin hierarchy - such as Dark Retribution, and, supposedly, planetary lasers.

    Yet, those devices are seem to be more consistent in their design. Presence of shadow elements and Underworld's symbology while is subtle, is consistent with the rest of gremlin technology. Consider here instances as such as the Collector and Incinerators.

We can make an educated guess that Cradle's defenses did consist of the same laser technology found in the factory, but, due to subtle coloring, also possess shadow-damage.

It is through the analysis of the events preceding the infiltration of the factory by Spiral Order in ["Built to Destroy" mission]() we can discover the scope of gremlin technology and advancements, which we see as thematically consistent with the earlier case of laser technology, acknowledging multitude of other motifs and preestablished principles across Cradle.

- `Deep within a toxic cavern lies a hidden test lab that gremlins have been using as a testing ground for components of Project R. One of these components still in development is reported to have schematics for the project close by. If this is true there will likely be a terminal of some kind close to one of Project R's components. Locate the terminal and recover the schematics for analysis. It should shed light on the exact nature of Project R` ([Plan of Attack](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plan_of_Attack)).

    Power grid is hidden within the toxic cavern and contains a hull of an inactive Roarmulus Twin. The power complex itself, in its purpose is reminiscent of Razwog's facility, as in both cases the centerpoint is the power cords leading up to the mission's key element, either being the generator, or the first introduction of Roarmulus Twins' design.

    The other element, which we have [discussed in relation to Maskeraith](), is the pattern of secret facilities being located in the caverns.

- `Intel had reported a gremlin deconstruction crew dismantling a portion of the Clockworks in order to generate scrap resources for use in their Project R. Using powerful welding torches, they are truly burning the place to the ground. One of the squads investigating the site has gone missing and is believed to be now held in captivity at the site. Infiltrate the fiery deconstruction zone and rescue the captive knights. But be warned, the deconstruction crew are said to have a powerful security construct hidden somewhere on site` ([High Temperature Hostages](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/High_Temperature_Hostages)).

    Rhe description suggests, based both on the rank missions' activity and tone of other descriptions, that the process of Roarmulus Twins' construction is done with a high pace and alarming priority.

    It is also here [oilers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lichen#Oiler) are found, with a visible presence of abundant slime, seen previously in the context of Herex's compound 42.

- `A gremlin logging operation has been discovered in levels known as the 'Jigsaw Valley'. These strangely carved islands are home to an even stranger species of twisting trees that gremlins seems to be determined to completely wipe out. Spiral HQ believes that gremlins are using the lumber from this operation as resources for the development of Project R and needs you to enter the Jigsaw Valley and shut it down` ([Axes of Evil](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Axes_of_Evil)).

It is here we should delve into the final assessment of the species of trees and plants found across Clockworks, mentioned in the quote: `These strangely carved islands are home to an even stranger species of twisting trees ...` ([Axes of Evil](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Axes_of_Evil)).

#### Ironwood, Wyrmwood, and Twisting Trees

Here we build upon the [previous introduction of ironwood and other types of wood](), as ones with fictional properties. It is within the context of Roarmulus Twins Ironwood and other types of trees are worth noting outside of the analysis of alchemy of ironmight equipment, specifically due to the context of [Axes of Evil](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Axes_of_Evil) mission: `A gremlin logging operation has been discovered in levels known as the 'Jigsaw Valley'. These strangely carved islands are home to an even stranger species of twisting trees that gremlins seems to be determined to completely wipe out`.

As gremlins were harvesting trees of [Aurora Isles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aurora_Isles), Spiral Order has described those trees as `even stranger species of twisting trees` ([Axes of Evil](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Axes_of_Evil)), which allows us to suggest that those tree are not a familiar species of plants to Isorans.

Then, at the end of the mission knight is rewarded with the [Redwood Bracelet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Redwood_Bracelet). This seems as a direct connection between the type of wood of those twisting trees and the bracelet, both being made of redwood.

If we extrapolate this idea onto other types of wood, we can make a solid connection, that all of those twisting trees correspond to types of wood found across Clockworks through existence of other types of bracelets: [Driftwood Bracelet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Driftwood_Bracelet) and [Ironwood Bracelet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironwood_Bracelet). These items, we believe, _imply that the trees of those species were present during existence of the Ironmight kingdom_, linking back to te idea of _most of regions within Clockworks coming from a harvested precursor planet_.

Then there is the [Wyrmwood bracelet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wyrmwood_Bracelet). All of bracelets made of wood grant resistance to shock, and they have a parity to according materials based on naming convention, color, and star rarity. Among them, Wyrmwood bracelet is the only 5-star trinket, and there is no 5-star variant of wood, as ironwood is the last material in this roster, being a material of 4-star rarity rating. We suggest, that there is a type of wood which is called wyrmwood, in its properties surpassing [ironwood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironwood): `A pristine log of one of the hardest substances known to the Spiral Knights`.

We can also figure out what wyrmwood looks like based on other bracelets:

- [Driftwood Bracelet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Driftwood_Bracelet) has pale brown color scheme, as driftwood inventory icon. Driftwood bracelet it is acquired for 5 forge sparks.
- [Redwood Bracelet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Redwood_Bracelet) has bright red color scheme, while redwood inventory icon has pale red or pink color. redwood bracelet is acquired for 20 forge sparks.
- [Ironwood Bracelet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironwood_Bracelet) same as ironwood inventory icon has metallic grey color scheme. Ironwood bracelet is acquired for 50 forge sparks.
- [Wyrmwood Bracelet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wyrmwood_Bracelet) is bright green and is acquired for 100 forge sparks.

Wyrmwood is not usually referred as a species of wood, contrary to the term of ironwood, but its name can be translated to wormwood, reminiscent of both dragons, and their relatives - wyrns, - when existence of wyverns was suggested, and of celestial themes.

The celestial theme, mentioned in passing seems us to be applicable both through the morphology of the word, and, coincidentally, a name of a _star_, mentioned in the Book of Revelations:

<BookCitation source="Revelation 8:1-11">

Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.

The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled down on the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.

The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a huge mountain, all ablaze, was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned into blood, a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.

The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water ‚Äî the name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter, and many people died from the waters that had become bitter.

</BookCitation>

Considering a more fantastic setting we are working with and more direct inspiration and naming parity, here we suggest, a parallel can be drawn between wyrmwood, wyverns, celestial ore, and sun silver, going beyond regular interpretation of wormwood. But, it is a wood nonetheless, evident by a bracelet of amplified, compared to ironwood, properties.

One particular inspiration we suggest taking place here. Ironwood is a forest in norse mythology, inhabited by jotun. Then we had a single instance of [Ironwood Sentinel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironwood_Sentinel#Ironwood_Sentinel), which is a weaponized [lumber](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironwood_Sentinel#Lumber) with an axe. There are [Void Lumbers, which behave as lumbers, but possess an axe](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironwood_Sentinel#Void_Lumber).

We have previously suggested that in the context of norse mythology, valkyries of heavenly kingdom could have interacted with tortomega. Then gremlins would harvest the materials from the floating isles, which we have established to belong to tortomega based on its' ruins designs and gun puppy statues. Tortomega, as constructs, drop sun silver, which we have proposed being refined celestial ore, relation to heavens due to its description. Then, as between tortomega civilization and gremlins there was a period of time, attributed to Almire, Ironmight Kingdom was proposed to inhabit this area.

So, could it be that wyrmwood is an instance of the heavenly wood? We believe, considering its presence, it could. The fact that this wood grants most protection of shock status, seem to suggest its origins connected to sky, reminding of owlites' developments against effects of shock and fire. Here a connection to heavens also could be established though the presence of wyverns, potential descendants of dragons, which we have concluded being a unique specie.

Lastly, as we have introduced this idea in the end of chapter 7 and 8, Valkyries are guards of heavenly kingdom, and the Sleeper is the closest to a god-like entity, devoid of protection by the time Spiral Order had arrived - due to those motif, we had proposed, that Sleeper was protected by valkyries of heavenly kingdom, referred in case of Armor of the fallen, as the paradise (`A cursed suit of armor once worn by a celestial being cast down from paradise` - [Armor of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Armor_of_the_Fallen)). The paradise, as a term in its literal interpretation - one most probable, given adjacent motifs, assumes a divine presence, to which Sleeper seems us to fit particularly well. __This proposal, through this logic, explain a theme of protection for Sleeper before Gremlins.__

As for the Roarmulus Twins, we suggest that at least ironwood was harvested to construct their armor, as an accent is made on it: `These giant gun puppies showcase impenetrable armor and high powered munitions. Their skin is so thick they are only vulnerable to fraternal firepower` ([Monstrous Codex: Roarmulus_Twin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Roarmulus_Twin)). It is unknown, weather wyrmwood was intended to be used in the construction of the Twins.

#### Gun Puppies: From Dragons to Red Roarmulus Twins

We have proposed, the tier 1 gun puppies were made of stone, designed and created by descendants of dragons - tortomega, to imitate dragons. Howlitzers became undead drakes. While we have covered tier 1 designs, tier 2 and 3 were not. So far we have only drawn parallels between extreme design of Red Roarmulus Twins to elemental tier 3 gun puppies.

The tier 1 origin's idea was based on the design of tier 1 gun puppies, specifically, their outer shells being made of stone, as well as lacking more complex metal designs of the rest of gremlin constructs, apart from lumbers. We keep in mind, that tier 1 gun puppies were seen with a revealed hull, containing mechanical internals. This structure is reminiscent of tortodrones, whose externals are made of stone, while those are identified as constructs.

As with the topic of the collector, elemental gremlin technology is also present for gun puppies and rocket puppies. Specifically in the form of elemental variants. By that we mean only tier 1 gun puppies were invented by tortomega, as only they possess consistent stone-like design, without any complex forms or separate jaw, as tier 2 and above, and elemental variants.

It can be argued that rocket puppy is on the same primitive design, but it would seem anachronistic fot tortomega utilize metal-made rockets, as we have seen them use depleted mineral shards in no-less effective manner. But, even this argument considered, tortodrones can be brought up, as they are the most effective demonstration of military abilities of tortomega civilization, albeit focused on minerals and stone. Considering it, we lean to tier 1 rocket puppies being invented later by gremlins.

Elemental gun puppies, on the other hand, do not have bolted foundation and generally look more arcane or fantasy-like - with glowing spirals incorporated in their designs. But here we should note a common element found across manufactured equipment - the 3-dot triangular shape present, which is seen on high-tech [equipment](https://media3.spiralknights.com/wiki-images/9/9e/Radiant_Pulsar-Equipped.png) and [devices](https://media3.spiralknights.com/wiki-images/f/f4/Monster-Slush_Puppy_3.png), reminding of tactical markings.

##### Red Roarmulus Twins

Apart from those design, we should look at both Roarmulus Twins and Red Roarmulus twins in most proper manner.

In this context, we reiterate on the specificity of their design, as far more hazardous, as they seem structurally unstable, as well as lacking any gremlin writings present on regular Roarmulus Twins.

The description of the Shadow Ironclaw Munition Factory with the design of its enemies seem to suggest, that it is not an uncommon design choice, but rather extrapolated onto larger constructs, reminiscent of more deteriorated state of corrupted tortodrones and elemental gun puppies, _as if the introduction of elemental powers closer to magic amplifies some aspects of the construction and reduces others._

And it is through gun puppies we can observe an extent to which gremlin technology utilizes elemental properties, which will be important [in relation to the magitech of Clockworks proper]().

Fiery variant of gun puppies - [Red Rovers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_puppies#Red_Rover) and [regular Gun Puppies](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_puppies#Gun_Puppy) are in a unique position as they have boss variants, Roarmulus Twins. While gun puppies might not be of such great interest for us, apart from mentioned gremlin writings on the armor plates, the Red Roarmulus Twins are. In fact, those writings can be distinguished only through direct view of the Red Roarmulus Twins' texture, which does seem as they are not intended to be seen.

Red Rovers have an attack same as Lord Vanaduke in his last phase, _which demonstrates the extent of powers of the cursed entities_. But, at that, only tier 3 red rovers are seen to be explicitly burning, with visible glow between the joints of the armor plates, as well as glowing spiral slab on top.

Red Roarmulus twins have only external layer of armor plates damaged by fire, while the internal components are seemingly red-hot, similar to red rovers. At that, the construction of lasers is also unique, as they are red, which are encountered only one more time - in Warmaster Seerus's chamber during the events of Operation Crimson Hammer.

The very existence of far more hazardous construction of the facility, as well as the state of Red Roarmulus Twins, we believe, demonstrates the extent at which elemental properties can be integrated in gremlin technology, albeit with a greater risks of the resulting constructing seeming more unstable, that is judging by Red Roarmulus Twins' and elemental gun puppies' designs.

#### Jelly Kingdom and Slimes

For the first time lichens and the existence of slime family of monsters was introduced in [Alien Ooze mission](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alien_Ooze), where Spiral Order has concluded, that lichens had arrived on a meteor: `Lichens are an alien species of the slime family thought to have come to the Clockworks via a meteor that crashed on to the surface of Cradle` ([Alien Ooze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alien_Ooze)).

There are 2 distinct categories of slimes in the slime family: lichens, which make up lichen colonies, and jellies, which comprise the majority of the Jelly Kingdom.

The main factor contributing to such classification is the physiology of both lifeforms, characterized by, generally, their viscosity and stability of form. We propose, that jellies are the descendant, or rather, matured lichens with a more complex, established hierarchy, - the jelly kingdom itself as an organized social structure. A following comparison of those species outlines their similarities and distinct features, which had led us to this proposal.

Both species have a distinct core. There are instances of multiple cores, making up sentient colonies (`Lichens are an alien species of the slime family ... formed from innumerable smaller slimes that form mobile, sentient 'colonies.'` - [Alien Ooze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alien_Ooze)), as well as large royal jellies.

A notion could be established here, that of both sentient lichen colonies of multiple cores and larger jellies with multiple cores function identically, _as a single, unified organisms_, capable of higher mental functions, as evident by existence of a monarchy of royal jellies - who, as far as presence of Ice Queen and Royal Jelly suggests, require at least 3 cores to function.

We derive this number from an amount of cores observed within the Ice Queen - 2 small cores rotating a larger one. We have not yet seen other instances of such pattern of rotation, as, usually, the cores rotate as a uniform structure within a volume of a body - he most prominent case being Jelly King.

That is, if we interpret the understanding of monarchy as universally common concept. And given general setting and presence of royal attributes, we can conclude that is indeed the commonly understood perception of monarchy.

This monarchy is embodied by [Jelly King's](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jelly_King) and [Ice Queen's](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ice_Queen) [crowns](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Crowns) having many of _common design elements of a european Imperial Crown_.

- `monsters within the slime family actually have a ruling aristocracy of elite slimes` ([Another Trace - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Another_Trace)).
- `The Royal Jelly Palace has frozen over and its king usurped by the true heir to the slimy throne, the frigid Ice Queen!` ([Release Notes: 2011.10.19](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2011-10-19)).
- `A regal crown resembling that ever-frigid Ice Queen. In addition to providing great defense, it is said to dramatically boost one's ego and create a cold detachment from those around them` ([Ice Queen Crown](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ice_Queen_Crown)).

##### Brutes

We known that those core-like objects are called cores based on the line of slime core items - `A fist-sized, gelatinous lump collected from a jelly` ([Gel Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gel_Core)). Gel Core is used in alchemy of [Jelly Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jelly_Helm): `Gelatinous headgear made from gooey guardians`. We can guess that those jellies' role is likely of guards, as it is those who guard entrance to the [Garden of Goo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Garden_of_Goo) behind [palace's walls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Palace). This pattern of explicitly distinct walls going to the sides of the main entrance as it was seen, is common among other fortifications, attributed to a few other civilizations found on Cradle - a motif of castles, first, albeit in a different context, pointed out in the [analysis of mysterious consoles' placements](), and then of the Great Citadel of Almire.

It is here we are presented with a hierarchy, characterized by coupling of rarity identified by Spiral Order, and families of slimes - of brutes, rock jellies, and nobles. Given prior identification of 2-star Gel Core as _a guardians'_ (`Gelatinous headgear made from gooey guardians` - [Jelly Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jelly_Helm)), we can outline a vague roles of the other names, starting from brutes.

The [Brute Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brute_Core): `An oozing blue lump from a particularly potent gelatinous opponent` is utilized for it set of 3-star slime-themed gear:

- `A hardy helm crafted from overly oppressive ooze` ([Brute Jelly Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brute_Jelly_Helm)).
- `A firm set of mucilaginous mail crafted from the remains of particularly antagonistic jellies` ([Brute Jelly Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brute_Jelly_Mail)).
- 3-star [Brute Jelly Band](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brute_Jelly_Band) trinket is also found here.

A brute, considering medieval themes of jelly kingdom and throne, considering specifics of hierarchy of brutes, rocks and royals, we may suggest the prior being a unit of castle's of kingdom's army.

There are a few other 3-star jelly cores:

- `A solid, pulsating lump that oozes with vitriol` ([Toxic Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxic_Core)).
- `A pungent mass pulled from a slimy assailant. Its aroma is an excellent remedy for insomnia, as well as nighttime sniffling and sneezing` ([Zee Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zee_Core)).

Those subspecies of slimes does not seem t belong to an aforementioned hierarchy, but rather a more primordial organization of lichens, where the cores are found, most prominently seen in [Zee Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zee_Core), due to a smaller scope of presence of sleep status effect.

##### Rock Slimes

The [Rocky Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rocky_Core): `A delicious gummy treat with an impenetrable rocky shell. More than a few teeth have been lost by knights attempting to get at the gooey interior`, bears themes of sturdiness of rock, also present in the transmuted 4-star equipment:

- `A tough topper tailored from jagged jelly` ([Rock Jelly Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Jelly_Helm)).
- `Crafted from the most adamant of slimy specimens, it also functions as an emergency source of calories for stranded knights` ([Rock Jelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Jelly_Shield)).
- `This gelatinous gear combines the sturdiness of stone with the piercing protection of sticky goo. its a wonder that you managed to beat up the jelly this is made out of` ([Rock Jelly Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Jelly_Mail)).
- A 4-star [Rock Jelly](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Jelly_Band) trinket is found here.

We can suggest those being the heavy infantry of the kingdom, as well as them being the closest to royalty, as they have 4-star rarity.

##### Royalty and Nobles

The [Royal Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Core): `A sweet-smelling lump of ooze collected from a particularly noble specimen of slime` specifies the role and position of those slimes. Royal Core is utilized in most of 5-star slime-themed equipment, such as [Royal Jelly Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Mail): `A viciously viscous set of armor crafted painstakingly from the most noble specimens of quivering slime`. This notion is also observed in the trinket of [Royal Jelly Band](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Band).

##### Properties of Slime

These cores demonstrate color variation in types of jellies, but also their properties and taste. The latter is specified by the alchemy tree of jelly shields:

- `it also functions as an emergency source of calories for stranded knights` ([Rock Jelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Jelly_Shield)).
- `it is durable, light, and delightfully berry-flavored` ([Brute Jelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brute_Jelly_Shield)).

This attribute, with consideration of danger is slime (`Please note that members of the slime monster family (jellies, lichens, polyps, glop drops, Royal Jelly, Ice Queen) are not edible and should not be ingested under any circumstance, despite the fact that some may resemble a confection` - [Regarding Slimes](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/102352)), can be explained through a property of not lichens, but of tropical frogs due to the contrast color being a sign of toxicity, as a lead.

It is known that at least lichens arrived on a meteor, and, due to anatomical and biological similarity of jellies and lichens, we consider both being alien to Cradle. Apart from it, jellies, and specifically royal slimes, have visible core as large lichen colonies.

The [Daybreaker Band](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Daybreaker_Band) line of trinkets specifies as being: `A curious circle coated with calcified slime`. This is important, as proposes a property of slime to calcify - which, in fact, is seen both in Polyps and in larger lichen colonies - _as the spikes they possess are most reminiscent of calcified slime_.

It is also important to mention a color shift of lichen colonies as they grow larger. Lichen colonies as well as jellies both are also capable of extending their spikes through the ground - this trait is particularly unique in general context to connect both species to a common ancestor, which, as we have suggested, are lichens, specifically yellow lichens.

Under this logic it is the left ambiguous, how creatures like blast cubes, toxigels, slooms, and by proxy void gels came to existence, as they look and act practically same as lichens, yet have a single larger core. We will keep them in mind until later discussion.

###### Themes of Sleep, Solstice and Alchemy

The [Somnambulist's  Totem](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Somnambulist%27s_Totem) is described as `An ordinary object with a unique texture and weight, the result of having been partially digested by a Sloombargo`, also suggests an existence of residue left by slimes. In both cases - of Daybreaker band and Somnambulist totem there is a distinct accent on a _transitory time_, a _transition from night to day_, a change. This is seen in the alchemy line of Daybreaker Band.

The somnambulist's Totem has similar theme, as it bridges the gap between day and night through a phenomenon somnambulistic walk, or, dream-like. If we develop this ide further - a somnambulist, metaphorically, would be anyone traversing the Starlight Cradle, marking it to a dream. That is not to say that Starlight Cradle does not physically exist, rather that the totality of its properties frames it as dream-like. We will keep this theme of dreams in mind.

There is also the https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Solstice_Ring which in its recipe combines concepts of say and night, represented by:

- `An enchanted ring that embodies the spirit of the solstice. Its sparkling silver luster shines brightest during the winter months` https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silver_Solstice_Ring
- `An enchanted ring that embodies the spirit of the solstice. Its glittering golden luster shines brightest during the summer months` https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Golden_Solstice_Ring

And we we are to apply alchemical motifs - the fact that Grand Solstice ring is a combination of opposites, which embodies characteristics of both while being greater - as `Grand` - than its components individually, seems to be one of more distilled metaphors for an alchemical motif.

More so, the color scheme of Grand Solstice Ring is of _red and white - which are absent in the Silver and Gold bands_. While silver is attributed to the Moon or night, and gold is attributed to Sun and day, red and white together are explained by an alchemical symbolism - of an alchemical marriage of a metaphorical Red King and White Queen, which themselves embody and encompass characteristics of Sun and Moon.

While not directly related to alchemy, an idea of transition from night to day, an idea of somnambulism, existence of Starlight Cradle itself, - all are found in relation to slime family of monsters on Cradle - is a pattern nonetheless.

As there is a distinction between lichens and slimes, we propose, that the aforementioned theme of night passing into day amongst lichens is _a metaphor for emergence of consciousness_ - __a jelly kingdom__, - a complex hierarchy of individual consciousnesses arriving from a hivemind of primordial lichen colonies, bridged by a concept of multiple slime cores and a greater complexity.

Under this interpretation, Starlight Cradle becomes even more so important to the development of jelly kingdom, as its naming and themes may be interpreted under a few new perspectives, and that is while the location itself is mostly disconnected from the rest of Cradle, apart from containing the same common strata of ruins.

##### Glop family of Slimes

On the other hand, there are minis, [shankles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shankle), and [glop drops](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Glop_Drop), which lack a distinct core:

- Minis originate from polyps, as implied by the throne room of the Royal Jelly Palace.
- Drops are widespread in compounds and treasure vaults, which contains a third specie of slimes - shankles. Yet, based on the tier 3 designs, there is a possibility of them possessing a core, which can be reshaped, or at least, an inner glow, which is more probable as no other slime species were capable of drastic changes of their shape.
- Shankles are only species which have a distinct biological features, such as an eye, eyes, or a mouth.

Considering the behavior of mimics, we can suggest those were in proximity of gremlin settlements and facilities. But, they do have an implication of an existing hierarchy, as [Treasure Mimic's](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Treasure_Mimic) tendrils have a crown of an imperial design. Through the presence of tendrils and their behavior - as ones emerging from the ground, - we can confirm, that shankles are sub-specie of slimes, diegetically.

#### Gremlin Bioengineering

Across the suggested physiology of slimes, existence of [toxigels](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lichen#Toxigel), [toxoils](), and [quicksilvers]() subspecies seem to become more so nuanced.

We propose, that during observed events both gremlins and Spiral Order had gained understanding of slimes' physiology, which had allowed for both to develop their own technologies.

It is important to establish, which slimes we consider artificial, as well as describe the reasoning behind this selection.

##### Blast Cubes

Under current proposal, we suggest, that [Blast Cubes](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jelly#Blast_Cube) are artificial slimes, created by gremlins. We propose such origin due to Cubes' unique and unstable property to explode - this characteristic is not observed anywhere else, nor in any slime family. Yet, [Blast Cubes](), [explosive blocks](), and _Collector's bombs_ seem to have a _common nature or physical resemblance_, which could be a budget restriction, or an intentional design choice guided by gremlin technological advancements. Yet, while there is existence of an explored and an established link between compound 42 and toxic gels, there is no such link for blast cubes. This is what we will attempt to establish.

Blast Cubes have a peculiar variation in color, transitioning from _yellow, to _reddish crimson_, and finally to _purple_ depending on Clockworks depth or tier.

Visibly cracked blackened edges on all variants of the Cubes give impression of cooler areas on top of heated surface, _reminiscent of molten metal dross_. This theme of heat links those to Vog's curse within Firestorm Citadel, and to industrial motif of molten slag as an unstable result of heavy industry. The latter reminds us of [Blast Furnaces across Clockworks](), which, given their name, seem to fit well with abn established industrial theming.

In the latter two variants blast cubes possess _lightning arcs_ around the core within the main body of slime, an established so far element of an energy excess.

When Blast Cubes are damaged enough, stability of they body seem to falter similar to larger jellies, - Jelly Kings' and Ice Queen's deaths, - as more lightnings emerge from the core and confinement of main body of slime across all explosive variants. In the very final moment the core explodes, suggesting that it being the energy source for the slime, apart from its nerve center. _This distinction in self-destructing purpose seems too rare to be an evolutionary trait_.

##### Presence of Explosive Blocks and Gun Blocks for Owlites

As Blast Cubes function very similar to Explosive Blocks, we have to look at those within the context of they placement across the volume of Cradle and Clockworks.

They are, most strangely, present in the Scarlet Fortress. This becomes a question of their canon, as some elements, such as respawn pads, as we previously suggested, are not seemingly diegetic.

Yet, in the _Rampants_ Lockdown map, being the Scarlet Fortress, there are even gremlin [rocket blocks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Rocket_Block.png) on the east side of the castle, showing a pattern resembling early bastions. As rocket clocks are usually associated with gremlins, their presence coupled with Rampants being connected to Lockdown map lobbies, suggests 2 explanations: of those being placed in the far past, or, those are built later by those who organize the Lockdown. As the prior is more complex, one suggestion, coupled with presence of gun puppies, may be of those being rudimentary cannons, given less grounded themes of Owlites.

Weather this can be said of explosive blocks, we could not say with full certainty. The same can be attributed to higher tier gun puppies, such as those present in [Firestorm Citadel's Charred Court](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel/Charred_Court). As far as we are aware of gremlin technology, and as we mentioned it previously - a formidable chance of gremlins attempting to contain Firestorm Citadel exists, mainly due to [presence of elevators]().

With this, we are leaning to the idea of _explosive blocks' origins being rooted in Gremlin research_, while origin of _Blast Cubes_, given their more recent arrival as slimes, seems to be _that of artificial creation_.

More so, the design of explosive blocks become more so important, as it is a pulsing sphere, reminiscent of one within collpased grim gate's portal, but contained in a translucent cube. This reminds us of the countarpart of an explosive block within interior of the Core, being explosive sphere. We will keep this peculiarity in mind once we get to the analysis of the Core proper, and [the other block, which case its instance within the Core](#ghost blocks).

##### Toxigels, Oilers, Toxoils

Encountered [Toxins]() and [Oilers]() are placed together mainly due to [the contents and context of compound 42]().

Based on the memos in the facility: `it seems to have formed an intelligence well beyond the scope of a standard bio-toxin` ([Compound 42 - Containment - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42/Containment)), - it seems that the biological weapon in question was not intended to become such as it is seem by the time the facility is being burned to the ground. But, a plausible explanation can be presented, that those weapon were derived of slimes.

Event of the Vile Engine seem to suggest that the slime generator, while in-game were seen to produce quicksilver lichens, are in fact capable of both, judging by the outer regions of generators' influence, resulting in creation of the Rotting Metropolis: `It would seem as though those slime generators have been around much longer than we thought, seeping their vile toxins into any levels that should be near them. A modern city, much like those that the devilites inhabit seems to be overrun with these toxins, and was probably left behind by both the devilites and gremlins as a result. Now a legion of slime and undead creatures haunt the place, festering in the poisons that linger in the air` ([The Rotting Metropolis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Rotting_Metropolis)).

As for the [oilers](), tubes of dark liquid, oil, are found in the end of compound 42 and cisterns in the final arena of [Terminal Meltdown, Fuel Depot Entrance](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Terminal_Meltdown_Fuel_Depot_Entrance.png). Those seem as evidence of oilers' artificial nature.

And lastly, the fact [toxigels]() and oilers were mixed to create [toxoils](), unique subspecies to compound 42, suggests in most direct manner capacity of _gremlin researchers to create or derive engineered subspecies of slimes_.

Notably, when oiler is ignited, its core also burns, making it visible only in such state. This industrial motif is also present for quicksilver lichens.

##### Quicksilver Lichens and Mercury

As [toxoils were purposed to become bioweapons](), as [blast cubes were devised as mobile bombs](), as [oiler were used in the heating and smelting facilities](), _quicksilvers_, we believe, are utilized as _mobile batteries_.

The first element is lichens' name, - quicksilver, - is an archaic term for mercury. The design of lichens suggest it being true, as quicksilver has same reflective properties, attributed to mercury.

While a connection between mercury and self healing of those lichens may not relate to anything in particular, it is important to look at other aspect of their design and themes, present across Spiral Order equipment - [quicksilver armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Quicksilver_Mail) alchemy tree, including [Mercurial Demo set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mercurial_Demo_Suit).

The persisting theme is one of electricity:

- `A fine set of mail made of what was once a Quicksilver` ([Quicksilver Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Quicksilver_Mail)). Despite referring to mercury in the past tense, the mail remain with this name. Quicksilver in this context might mean the lichen, as alchemy of the next in line upgrade - [Charged quicksilver Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Charged_Quicksilver_Mail) contains all of the familiar slime-related materials, such as gel cores, [Brute Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brute_Core), [Gel Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gel_Core), and [Volt Oil](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volt_Oil).
- [Charged Quicksilver Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Charged_Quicksilver_Mail) is a direct upgrade of the prior with instruction of [Thunderball](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Thunderball) into its alchemy.

    The description of [its charged helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Charged_Quicksilver_Helm): `An enhanced Quicksilver Helm conductive to the destruction of electrical foes`, - might suggest that it is a state of armor, or rather, mercury/quicksilver itself, within which charged quicksilver lichens are encountered.

- The final upgrade, [Mercurial Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mercurial_Mail): `A supreme set of silver armor that'll put a spring in your step while keeping shocks out of it`, and [Mercurial Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mercurial_Helm) - `A sublime silver helmet that'll let you move as swiftly as water, though perhaps not quite so swiftly *through* it` have an emphasis on this armor's defense supremacy and speed, which is usually attributed to chemical properties of mercury as a liquid.
- Same motif of speed is found in the [Mercurial Demo Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mercurial_Demo_Suit) set: `A demo suit made from gremlin technology. It is for the bomber that wants a boost of speed, more power and a greatly reduced chance of dying by electrocution`.

    While it is indeed stated that the armor utilizes gremlin technology, most prominently [Gremlonium](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlonium): `A highly advanced compound created by gremlin engineers to power their most devious machines. It constantly emits an unsettling hissing sound`, we propose, that there is greater symbolic and alchemical meaning to be found, which will be analyzed after the initial coverage of Clockworks' infrastructure.

But currently, as far as initial role of quicksilvers go, they seem to represent a utilitarian role of batteries, as their gel is found across highly dangerous facilities with electric themes, specifically, [Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory).

Moreover, quicksilver lichens are produced by [slime generators](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine/Processing_Plant) during the [Vile Engine mission](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine).

We have already discussed the nature of the Rotting Metropolis, using it to interpret existence of those generator in favour of Herex. Yet, the description `It would seem as though those slime generators have been around much longer than we thought, seeping their vile toxins into any levels that should be near them` ([The Rotting Metropolis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Rotting_Metropolis)) is particularly vague.

##### Environmental Themes of Gremlins

One more explanation we may present here is of purely functional role of Slime Generators, unrelated to Herex or general strategic role of the prior.

This proposal states, that slime generators are a method of creating quicksilvers, while generators' poison themes may be attributed to the byproducts, if we are to commit to environmental aspect of gremlins across rank missions, specifically, of [Beyond the Axes of Evil](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Beyond_the_Axes_of_Evil): `Despite your previous efforts, gremlins have reformed their logging operation in the Jigsaw Valley in order to supply their munitions plants with resources. Given the results of their last project, the Roarmulus Twins, Spiral HQ would like you to end their eco-destruction before it becomes anything more serious!`

The toxic aspect then is the reimagining of mercury as a toxic chemical element, specifically, its vapours, suggesting a degradation of [quicksilvers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lichen#Quicksilver) to [toxigels](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lichen#Toxigel), _mirroring the toxicity of expired lithium batteries_.

But, we acknowledge that, as far as this suggestion goes and as it is the only one so far, which manages to plausibly explain an aforementioned design discrepancy, it is based more in the motifs, which, even when focused upon, are rather vague to be confidently substantial, compared to the alchemical theme we were focusing upon throughout the analysis.s

##### Node Field Technology and Gel Glue

In case of gremlins it was creation of artificial subspecies of lichens. As for Spiral Order, there is [Node equipment](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/102352): `On a related note, while studying slime-compromised knights, our scientists discovered new ways of incorporating slime material into camo. You may find an assortment of these in the Slime Prize Box, which may contain the following: Node Slime Masks; Node Slime Guards; Node Slime Crusher (sword); Node Slime Wall (shield); Writhing Tendrils; Node Field Aura` ([Regarding Slimes](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/102352)).

Given the extent gremlins went with devising purposed species, we can set general boundaries on what to expect from Spiral Order.

There are a few related Node items, which can be acquired from [Slime Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slime_Prize_Box) and [Slime Lockbox](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lockbox#Slime_Lockbox) (`A slippery, slimy lockbox won at the Golden Slime Casino. It contains one of many special items. It can be opened with a Slime Key or a Silver Key. On the side, very small markings seem to read "###"` - [Slime Lockbox](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slime_Lockbox)):

- `This caloused carving crusher cascades fury upon fatigued foes` ([Node Slime Crusher](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Slime_Crusher)).
- `This weathered wobbling wall can withstand a walloping when wielded by unwaveringly willed warriors` ([Node Slime Wall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Slime_Wall)).
- `A variegated veiling ward worn by vehemently venerated victors` ([Node Slime Guards](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Slime_Guards)).
- `A menacing mask of malice made from obliterated ominous ooze` ([Node Slime Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Slime_Mask)).

Apart from the rhythmic writing, the design is one of greater importance here. Most of this equipment contains a glowing image within its slime structure, which, due to similarities to [Node Field Aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Field_Aura#Node_Field_Aura), we will refer to as the Node Field - a series of pathways, which, given our current understanding of slime family of monsters could be the very structure which propagates over the main body of a lichen outside of its core, granting resilience. Then there are prismatic [Writhing Tendrils](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Writhing_Tendrils) and the [Node Field Aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Field_Aura#Node_Field_Aura) itself.

In relation to our initial proposal, [Node Container](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Container) and [Node Receiver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Receiver) seem to be devices, linked to the Node Field, as both the container and reciever seem to emit a light meant, based on devises' names, to contain and recieve the object it surrounds. In case of the container it is the armor, and for reciever, it seems to be the helm. And given the matallic design of both the accessories and guards, they seem to be intended to be used together.

Considering that the gel core is essential to lichens and jellies, with exception of minis and shankles, it serves as a nerve center, as those make up sentient colonies. Gel Core is likely _capable of producing slime_, similar to bone marrow:

- `An oozing blue lump from a particularly potent gelatinous opponent` ([Brute Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brute_Core)).
- `A delicious gummy treat with an impenetrable rocky shell. More than a few teeth have been lost by knights attempting to get at the gooey interior` ([Rocky Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rocky_Core)).
- `A sweet-smelling lump of ooze collected from a particularly noble specimen of slime` ([Royal Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Core)).

The underlying pattern is also present in the regular lineup of shields, entirety of the alchemy path of [Royal Jelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Shield), while it does not glow as the Node equipment. Notably, corresponding eqipment, such as armors or helmets, lack such feature and a glowing core, and contrary to those, the regular slime shields have an energy symbol depicted within the structure of the shield. At that note, regular shield lacks a complete, strongly connected geometry with no loose nodes of Node equipment.

We believe, there is a distinction between the energy core - which we came to undertand as the _mist energy collector or tank_, and the supposed node field core. Previously we have suggested the energy symbol to be the mist energy collecting device: `The Clockworks and most every machine the knights encounter run on energy, including their own power armor. All knight armor is equipped with a device that is able to constantly pull energy from the air; known as ‚Äòmist,‚Äô into their armor, allowing them to function and power up machinery they encounter. However, mist dissipates almost as quickly as it is acquired, and thus a knight‚Äôs mist energy can never be permanently stored ... Due to the intense power source at Cradle's core, the entire planet's atmosphere is imbued with loose, airborne mist energy. Each Spiral Knight will constantly absorb this mist energy` ([Energy - Lore - Cory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/index.php?title=Energy&oldid=20)), but, the glowing core of Node Field equipment has remained unknown. More so, there are other armors with seem to contain this element of technology, specifically, the modern plated armors, with [ancient]() and [volcanic]() variants possessing no such device on the front.

Given our understanding, we propose, that this element is indeed an artifical device meant to create environment - the Node Field, - for the gathered slime to be manipulated for defensive measures of the armor. While a speculation, paired with our ealierlier discussion reagrding those armors, as well as the context of energy tanks on knight's armor, we propose this device being the secondary power source, attributed for plated armors to their weight, and for Node field technology - its power source.

One particular element then remains, that of [Node Field aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Field_Aura#Node_Field_Aura) itself, as it extends past the knight into the surroundings. At the same time, the [promotional material](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slime_Prize_Box#Calendar) also depicts what seems to be _Node Field chamber_.

Due to this design choice we lean to a conclusion that the Node Field, at first, is a technology. But, as its design differs greatly from the rest of Spiral Order equipment, we have to assume that it is derived from a different place and time, as far as this concept can go. And to hold the structure of the gel itself through those artificial means, [Jelly Glue](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jelly_Glue) was manufactured: `A viscous compound developed by Biotechs to allow for the study of slime creatures. When mixed with slime and jelly matter, it allows for reshaping without losing its form. Though reserved for scientific purposes, the process is generally regarded as 'super fun'`, which seem to be a fitting to a degree candidate for the substance Node equipment utilizes.

It is also here a distinction between slime and jelly matter is made, which, given context, seem to be a far more advanced solution to utulization of slime. We arrive to such conclusion mainly by the fact of Node field technology seemingly requiring Node container to operate, which, as we have propsed, is used to contain the jelly components, while Jelly Glue makes the process of manufacture easier and grants shapeshifing capabilities to the material.

But, given existence of a regular lineup or jelly-based armors and the recency of the discovery (`On a related note, while studying slime-compromised knights, our scientists discovered new ways of incorporating slime material into camo` - [Regarding Slimes](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/102352)), we would suggest those being a later development without utilization of Node field, rather relying on the Jelly Glue. If we are to develop this idea further, it is this alchemy tree's equipment can be alchemized at the Sanctuary Alchemy Machine, which seem to contain most advanced equipment in terms of found on Cradle materials.

##### Starlight Cradle and Ancient Titans

As we have [mentioned earlier themes of dreams amongst lichens](), it is here we will discuss it proper.

There is Starlight Cradle, while it is of the same nature as the rest of Aurora Isles, it is distinguished by the presence of sleep mist, instrumental to its design: `Beneath a moonlit sky azure islands drift in a sea of stars. These islands are home to creatures that are more than happy to creep upon those who succumb to this world's endless lullaby` ([Starlight Cradle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlight_Cradle)).

Meteor motif within this region in particular is more so interesting, as is it on meteor lichens were supposed to arrive, and the region has Meteor Mile in 3 different variants of a fixed layout. This seems intentional, both in naming and design. Not particularly related to the region, a [scenario room with a smoldering meteor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-Lichenous_Lair_1.png) exist, but, it seems to be too recent of an event, due to burning fires. Due to this, it is left unknwon weather this is the original meteor lichens had arrived on Cradle, but one related as a phenomenon, as it is due to that the area has such specific name.

There is also the [Torporal Titan](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torporal_Titan), but before it, we must look at properties of the equipment, alchemized from this region's materials. It is also here, at Meteor Mile 2, we can see a direct parallel and common motif of both Gun Puppy constructs and gun puppy statues placed nearby, as if _the mechanical ones are meant to mirroe the more ancient stonework ones_.

Among currently present sequences of levels, only [Torporal Titan](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torporal_Titan) lacks a narrative in its name. [Stygian Steeds](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_City/Stygian_Steeds) were present during the events of the Return of Ur, as the stygian, or Underworld, steeds are trojans of the legion of Ur, as they were sealed in the Underworld. And [Briar Bone Barrage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Concrete_Jungle/Briar_Bone_Barrage) is seemingly named after a unique encounter with [Toxilargo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxilargo#Toxilargo), but here we can rely on previous levels, whose names mark the extent of the poisonous miasma.

The location of Starlight Cradle is more structurally intact compared to the rest of the regions of, initially, the same biome. As the rest of Aurora Isles, this region had also been populated by tortomega, but, due to relation to meteors and unique state lichens are found in, it was overtaken by the latter in the same manner as Royal Jelly Palace. Potentially being the source of all lichens. Yet, this would not explain nature of sleep here, which we will analyze next.

Themes of stars and sleep are related. Most of the related to this location gear uses [Zee Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zee_Core) (`A pungent mass pulled from a slimy assailant. Its aroma is an excellent remedy for insomnia, as well as nighttime sniffling and sneezing` - [Zee Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zee_Core)) in its alchemy:

- [Starlit Demo Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlit_Demo_Suit) 5-star armor has usage of both [Royal Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Core), and [Meteor Mote](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Meteor_Mote), which is stated to be used by gremlins: `A small piece of a rare material that is said to have fallen from the sky. Gremlins typically use it in the construction of power sources`.

  This further suggests this region being related to meteors in the context of lichens' arrival to Cradle, and even gremlins, potentially introducing them to further creation of artificial slime subspecies'. Considering that the meteor had to end up at Cradle's surface, and the Aurora Isles are particularly aerial region, this might not be a coincidence, but an intentional decision for both explaining lichens' origins and to disclose more regions of tortomega civilization beyond Wildwoods and general Aurora Isles.

  It was suggested, that the terrain was harvested from the surface of Cradle (`The Clockworks are a manufactured place, perhaps the worlds they contain are harvested from the terrain above. But how?`- [Recon Module: Gloaming Wildwoods - Euclid](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Recon_Module:_Gloaming_Wildwoods)) when Clockworks construction had initially began. Due to this, existence of slimes spicies on Cradle may be one preceeding gremlins'.

  Aurora Isles, notably, as we now know, are the place of Ironwood to be harvested, relating back to the question of the resources required to potentially construct tortodrones in the first place and then the Roarmulus Twins by gremlins.

- `An advanced, star-soaked hunting coat that will keep you awake even as it coddles you in downy comfort` ([Starlit Hunting Coat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlit_Hunting_Coat)). A wording of star-soaked is peculiar - as it is unknown weather this is a metaphor. If this property is to be interpreted literally, then, we are thinking of the sleep-inducing mist, naturally secreted by [Slooms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sloom#Sloom) and [Sloombargos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sloombargo#Sloombargo).

  This mist then is addressed directly:

  - `A powerful alchemical bomb that creates a thick fog of sleepy mist` ([Slumber Squall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slumber_Squall)).
  - `A Slumber Smogger modified to disperse sleepy smog over a wider range` ([Slumber Smogger Mk II](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slumber_Smogger_Mk_II)).
  - `An alchemical bomb that fogs an area with a sleep agent` ([Slumber Smogger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slumber_Smogger)).
  - `An illuminated helm strengthened against soporific smogs. its surprisingly soft inside` ([Starlit Demo Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlit_Demo_Helm)).
  - `An advanced hunting cap, illuminated and downy, that resists the strongest sleep mists` ([Starlit Hunting Cap](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlit_Hunting_Cap)).

  The nature of this mist will be important later.

- `Something has really riled up the Chromalisks in the levels below the town of Emberlight. Spiral HQ sent a squad in to investigate and they quickly fell off the radar. Now they've sent out a distress signal stating that they're cornered at depth 21 by chromalisks of all varieties. Biotechs speculate these chromalisks are agitated due to their proximity to the Core` ([In Cold Blood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/In_Cold_Blood)). This mission ends in the location, by the gate icon and by its design, in the Starlight Cradle - [Lizard Lounge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/In_Cold_Blood/Lizard_Lounge).
- [Slooms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sloom#Sloom) and [Sloombargos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sloombargo#Sloombargo) have a unique design of spikes, which are covered with ornamen glowing patterns.

  This shattered or cracked design is similar to other entities, such as [Gorgos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgo#Gorgo), Margrel, [corrupted tortodrones](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tortodrone), and [trojans](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Trojan). Although all of those examples are some of other way relate to Underworld, we believe this case, sleep is not related to Underworld, but it demonstrates a potentially different concept.

- Items of [Slumber Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slumber_Prize_Box) also relate to this region through the color scheme.
- The [Slime Lockbox](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lockbox#Slime_Lockbox) also contains trinkets relating to a time of day - 3-star [Early Riser Ring](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Early_Riser_Ring), 4-star [Dawn Bracelet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dawn_Bracelet), 5-star [Daybreaker Band](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Daybreaker_Band), all being synonyms of dawn.
- The [Jelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jelly_shield) alchemy tree, including [Savage Tortoise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Savage_Tortoise), provides sleep resistance.

  We have earlier proposed, that [Savage Tortoise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Savage_Tortoise) was designed by Owlites, but, there're no evidence of lichens existing that far into the past, not evidence of Owlites combating lichens. Although, it would not conflict with the existing timeline of events. More potential connections arise from earlier upgrades - `A shield alchemized from a hardened tortodrone shell. Its tough enough to dull a jelly barb on impact` ([Wild Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wild_Shell)). In fact, we still do not known the _nature of explicitly hardened shells derived of tortodrones_.

- The [Purrfect Katnip Pouch](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Purrfect_Katnip_Pouch) provides sleep resistance and is acquired for 100 [Primal Sparks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens), design-wise it is fitting.
- `An ordinary object with a unique texture and weight, the result of having been partially digested by a Sloombargo` ([Somnambulist's totem](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Somnambulist%27s_Totem)). Naming of a totem is peculiar, as there are only 2 other instances of a totem naming scheme being used, - gremlin and Underworld devices. As Apocrea was mention within the [memorandum](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/111472), and we have briefly mentioned it, here, we can focus on this concept. This naming of a totem within the context of Apocrea could be referencing Lovecraft's short story "Hypnos" and broader Dream Cycle, _as both relate to the greater physical effects of events within dreams on the percieved reality_.

##### Torporal Titans

We propose that at the center of region's identity and reason for its in-universe existence is the nature of the sleep mist, and it is one to be derived from tortomega. This connection we make due to the earlier lack of context for the Torporal Titan. Naming convention of titan is very rare and _is used selectively_ across items and places with at least some background.

For ancient equipment acquired for [Almirian Seals](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Token#Almirian_Seal), the [Ancient Plate Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Armor) and [Ancient Plate Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Helm), it was the thematic relation to moss and immensem - titanic (`A vestigial helm whose weight makes it unwieldy to all but those with titanic strength` - [Ancient Plate Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Helm)), - strength, affirmed by the slowness of movement, as the items were made of stone, and mean for bearer of such power to carry those. Here we reference the Ironmight set, which design-wise is similar, yet relates to different epoch of Ironmight kingdom, yet still heavy to induce slowness. It should be noted, that ancient equipment is also detrimental to sleep status effect.

Then the Titan Arcade gates were a key to establishing titans, tortomega, and creators of tortodrones, as labels for one ancient species of tortomega.

And here [Torporal Titan](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torporal_Titan) is an unchanging depth of 3 arenas within a seemingly intact location and architecture, reminiscent of stone halls of Gloaming Wildwoods, the [Roarsterous Ruins](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Roarsterous_Ruins). Considering the context of the location, _designed as the rest of Aurora Isles and contating the same strata of ruins_, we believe, this naming convention was intentional. While sleep may be related to titans, here it explicitly states the location to be the torporal titan itself - a slumbering or sleeping titan, a giant, if we refer to the exploration of the concept of titans in relation to Valkyries and [mysterious statues in their halls]().

It is then why a titan is sleeping? Given out proposal of titans being hunted by Undercorp through corruption of tortomega, we can speculate of those falling into a prolonged sleep for the threat to subside. On the other hand, the dormant state of titans may be inflicted by currently unknown properties of so called primordial lichens, which inhabit the region of Starlight Cradle, but, there are also no evidence for such narrative to exist.

Due to this, as a working proposal, we are leaning into, what we consider, satisfying narrative, of remaining titans felling veiled homeland, follwed by falling into a slumber, which utilized said sleeping mist, _ironically reminiscent of the cursed miasma_, to sleep util Undercorp becomes less of a threat.

##### Ice Queen

Ice Queen and rest of [Ice Cubes](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ice_Cube#Ice_Cube) can be grouped together as both have same freeze-related nature. Ice Cubes in particular can be re-frosted through application of frost status effect. As everfrost is extracted from freeze-themed enemies, and if anything, the state Royal Jelly Palace found in, __frozen over Royal Jelly Palace is most reminiscent of frozen Amu-Sol with everfrost's influence__.

As we have not seen Amu-Sol in its regular environment - as a regular dark city, but, have witness both instances of Royal Jelly Palace, we suspect of the same power to alter entirety of the environemnt to be used, none oher than presence of everfrost, a material, which came from Underworld.

As Maulos was involved with Amu-Sol, we suggest freezing of Royal Jelly Palace being of Ice Queen's doing, rather than a natural phenomenon, due to innate nature of Ice Cubes, as they are capable of generating ice on their own will.

Previously we have discussed how gremlins have engineered artificial subspecies of slime family of monsters, but the context of explicit royalty appearing in tandem withthe Swarm seems too specific.

Then there is presence of evil eye imagery on Ice Queen's crown, seen both of her variant, and one alchemized in the Sanctuary Alchemy Machine. We rely on it through connection to everfrost, as both had originated from the Underworld. The crown itself is made of [Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore), as suggested by the description of the latter: `It is often completely wasted on crowns and jewelry for slime royalty` ([Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore)). It was stated that slimes had overtaken the palace, so it could mean, in conjunction with usage of the ore in valkyrian armor, [Heavenly Iron Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Helm) specifically, that slime royalty had found the ore as heavenly kingdom was long gone, and created a crown. But why would the imagery of an eye, associated with the Underworld, be placed onto the crow of slime royalty?

Given our work throughout the previous chapters, we consider the Underworld, or Undercorp specifically, to the perpetrators behind later events while the Swarm takes main priority as the threat. How those relate to each other, we have previously suggested in the [analysis of Shadow Firestorm Citadel](), but the specifics and, most imporantly, _the means are still left unknown_.

Other than that, we are leaning to the idea of Ice Queen's presence correlating with other events revolving arounf Shadow Lairs, initially proposed in the [final analysis of Shadow Firestorm Citadel]().

##### Golden Slime Casino

In relation to both Jelly Kingdom and Undercorp, there is a location within the Clockworks, which is essentially a casino, populated by both parties and named the [Golden Slime Casino](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Golden_Slime_Casino).

From there we gat a few trivia regarding operation of undeercorp and potentially other companies from Underworld, the Jelly Kingdom, as well as phisiology of jellies, despite the joking nature of the location:

- `I just got back from debarber, can you tell?` ([Golden Slime Casino - Jelly Cube](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Golden_Slime_Casino)).

  This quatity of barbs to be removed, which we ealier identified to be calcified slime, was also observed by geoknights across Cralde at least for Ice Cubes:

  - `Don't mind Hubert, he's been de-spiked` ([Clockworks - Scanrio Room - Geo Knight](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scenario_room)).
  - [Haven Lab](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lab) in particular contains de-spiked Ice Cube.

- `One day I‚Äôll win enough to build my own palace! Glorp glorp!` ([Golden Slime Casino - Jelly Cube](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Golden_Slime_Casino)). This implies, that with enough crown, which are established to be also used by Jelly Kingdom, one could achieve a status of nobility within the hierarchy of the kingdom. This would also lead to the earlier method of jellies incorporating cores to be not the only method one can become a nobility, but rather the status of a clony itself, as an organism, grants physical power, demonstrated by lichen colonies and intances of jelly roaylty across Cradle. This can be a reasonable suggestion, given that Ice Queen has only 3 cores, instead of any larger number, obsersed the prior instances, and the fact she is stated to have usurped the palace: `The Royal Jelly Palace has frozen over and it's king usurped by the true heir to the slimy throne, the frigid Ice Queen!` ([Shadows Fall Over Cradle!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/29852)).

The jelly norse of the casino is identified as the royal jelly, also evident by its crown. Notably, this instance of royal jelly seemingly has a single royal core, which further contributes to a newer suggestion of kingdom's nature of nobility as one close to reality.

What is the relation of devilites to the casino, then? The [Yesmen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Yesman) at the [casino](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Golden_Slime_Casino) state:

- `Everyjelly is welcome at the Golden Slime!`
- `I‚Äôm sorry, you missed Happy Hour by a minute. Next time.`
- `Everyjelly is a winner at the Golden Slime!`
- `Undercorp employees get a free mug with every visit.`

Those quotes, we believe, hint at a business relation, wherein deveilites and companies of Underworld had their part in the existence of the casino, given they have special, although trivial, previledges. Finally, it is existence of the casino within Clockworks which may point to gremlins having a more multifaceted relation to Undercorp.

#### Gremlin Mending Rune, the Emblem

Gremlin Mending rune is a spell performed by gremlin menders of Darkfang clan.

This symbol is also identical to Spiral Order's gremlin enemy type classification image, and also, judging by general appearances, it is a consistent image across all gremlin clans.

Based on the fact that Crimson Order imagery is consistent across the facilities, we suggest that this more generalized symbol, an emblem, is of the Great Colony, Iron Law, or closely associated with those, as all known clans abide to the latter.

Weather it is Great Colony's emblem or symbol of order, might be resolved through the design of [Gremlin Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlin_Prize_Box). It is similar to the depiction of the familiar Spiral Order symbol on the [Raider Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raiders_Prize_Box).

More important in this context is the design of [Gremlin Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlin_Suit), as on its sleeves there is a symbol belonging to the Spiral Order, rather than one of gremlins'. The lockox itself bears the symbol. This parity of symbols and corresponding affiliations may allow to understand the meaning of gremlins' emblem precisely.

We start from the quote: `A village of outcasts, Emberlight serves as a refuge for gremlins who were banished from the Great Colony. Now they live humble lives, selling wares and repairs to passing travelers, always fearful that one day the gremlin king Tinkinzar would see fit to wipe them out entirely` ([Emberlight](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Emberlight)). One could be banished from the Order, being a discharge or dismissal, or from a habitat. Within this and earlier interpretations, we will consider Great Colony as a location, a metropolis.

##### Clans and Minerals

Then there are gremlin wares, such as toolboxes, which have familiar symbol engraved on them. In this direction of tools as a theme, we may look at gremlin mender's staff - a wrench with a mineral, identified as the [Wrench Wand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wrench_Wand): `A heavy hand tool favored by Gremlins. It's good for both tightening bolts and cracking skulls`. Due to presence of gremlin menders all across Clockworks, we can gather, that there exists a parity of prime mineral and gremlin calns, wherein, seemingly, mineral's color sets the prime color of the clan.

With this approach in mind, we can identify that parity:

- Tenderfoot clan gremlins have patches of their emblem with green background, menders urilize Valestone in their spells, placed within the wrench.
- Ironclaw clan is primarily yellow, with luminite being the mineral used by menders
- Darkfang clan is purple, menders of darkfang clan use dark matter, and are the only clan capable of reviving recently fallen gremlins.

As for the rune and its healing properties, it can be applied by gremlin menders to both other living entities as well constructs, including battlepods. In its behavior it resembles healing field of Silkwings, and the rune's emblem shimmers as the dread seal. Menders cast that rune through usage of a wrench equipped with luminite shard, which may point to identity of the principle behind healing.

There are also [healing totems](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Healing_Totem#Healing_Totem), found in the Firestorm Citadel after Nature Sprites had began putting out the fires. Those totems also resemble wrenches with mineral shards held within, which function as passive mending. As for their purpose, considering Herex's presence with a large squad of both gremlins and constructs, we suggest totems' placement here is the evidence of them passing through this route prior to knight's arrival.

Given the abilities of mender channeled through those specific mineral, we may cnsider those being charged variants of minerals, as those are effectively used in combat, such as [Sun Shards bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Shards): `A shard bomb formed from a small explosive encased in solar-charged Luminite. Whatever you do, don't look directly at it`.

But, apart from this pattern, gremlins do utilize all minerals in their weapons. Most common example here is the group of gremlin - knockers, - which are equipped with 2 smaller wrenches, but each with a different mineral. It seems that it is the interaction between those minerals which causes an explosion, which is weaponized:

- [Knocker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Knocker#Gremlin_Knocker): moonstone and crimsonite, inflicts no status effect.
- [Lighter](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Knocker#Gremlin_Lighter): crimsonite and luminite, inflicts fire.
- [Cooler](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Knocker#Gremlin_Cooler): valestone and moonstone, inflicts frost
  - [Deadly Crystal Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadly_Crystal_Bomb) consists of moonstone and valestone alloy, elemental damage (`A large chunk of Moonstone and Valestone alloy primed with a potent explosive. Studies have shown that this bomb can be used to reduce a zombie's craving for brains by up to 100% by blowing them to pieces` - [Deadly Crystal Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadly_Crystal_Bomb)).
- [Choker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Knocker#Gremlin_Choker): valestone and dark matter, inflicts poison.
- [Jumper](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Knocker#Gremlin_Jumper): moonstone and dark matter, inflicts shock.

Notably, those are the _uncommon-type combinations of minerals_ found across Clockworks, as evident by the [mineral frequency table](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Minerals#Acquisition), with moonstone-crimsonite being attributed rather to general gremlin stratum. Could it be, this __strategic placement of minerals is explained by their explosive nature__ of their interactions? But then, why frequent minerals are also present in those speculated to be dangerous combinations?

This emerging relation between minerals' themes, their natures, tethered by their application across Isoran and Gremlin technology made us think of a different notion, of concept of Five Elements in Godai.

Although interpretation within the context of fictional reality of Spiral Knights will differ, we will attempt to look for similarities and common themes, such as the aforementioned relations of statuses and minerals.

For that, minerals' descriptions should be brought to the shortest description:

- Crimsonite - passion, anger, strength
- Dark Matter - chaos, nothingness
- Luminite - faith, wisdom, zeal
- Moonstone - knowledge
- Valestone - essence of life

Dark matter is described as as essence of both chaos and nothingness. We have already discussed how this duality relates back to western alchemy. But what we have not mentioned up until now is the relation to Godai and its concept of the Void or Ku, as its fifth element, in most simple terms here being the abstraction of the being, it is the world spirit, cosmic Heaven. We must point out, Ku currently has no relation to the Void of Whitespace in particular, but it has very similar cosmic motif, as Energy is also ever-present - a notion, [discussed under similar motifs in relation to existence of auras and souls](), - a concept we are to explore deeper soon enough.

This relation of one of most prevalent to the timeline minerals - dark matter, - being used by one of more dangerous and deepest clans, seem to correlate with a different notion of _gremlins using shadow-based weaponry in the most severe cases_. And with this application the __symbolism of Underworld emerges, seemingly imprinting itself on gremlins' designs__, with such designs being the [Collector](), [Incenerators](), and [Electron bombs](), to name a few. Where this notion culminates, we are yet to see through.

##### Emblem of the Great Colony

Given this context of gremlin clans, what is then the emblem? As we have earlier suggested a parity between symbol of Spiral Order and of gremlins', we are leaning to the idea of the latter being a repsresentation for a concept, rather than a location.

As Spiral Order is to Isorans, so soomething is to gremlins, represented bytheir corrspnding symbol. And with our current understanding that missing element is the Iron Law, a core principle behind the existing social structure of gremlins on Cradle, and the __emblem of the Great Colony__, as the latter could not exist without the prior.

We can compare the outfits of Emberlight gremlins to ones of Great Colony - those possess an emblem of a circled cross, the imagery present across the town of Emberlight, as well as its districts, traversed [during the events of Winterfest]. This emblem, we believe, literally and symbolically crosses out the idea, represented by the Great Colony gremlins' emblem - of a bolt, placed into teeth of a wrench, and the Iron Law (`Gremlins of Emberlight not obey the Iron Law, so flee or die. We start over with Emberlight. New colony home to few of us: most ex-schemers, some merchants, some fighters, all traitors in the eyes of Great Colony Gremlins` - [Haven - Laboratory - Pakrat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pakrat)).

#### Minerals, Dread Velvet, and Complex 357

If we further look into applications of minerals, we come by a certain notion, observed within complex 357 and [Biscotti's kitchen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Total_Caketastrophe!/Chaos_in_the_Kitchen) of all places - of minerals being grinded into a powder, - of Valestone in the complex and dark matter in the kitchen.

Furthermore, as seen during [A Gremlin in Knead](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Gremlin_in_Knead) mission, possessed by [Dread Velvet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Velvet#Dread_Velvet) [Groat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Groat) was using moonstone for currently unknown means: `A dash of Moonstone, a pinch of...` ([A Gremlin in Knead - Moonstone Mixup - Groat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Gremlin_in_Knead/Moonstone_Mixup)).

We propose, the observed [Creep Cakes]() were _already sentient and hostile due to application of dark matter_, introduced by Biscotti: `
To speed up the process I may have used a teensy weensy bit of pure, unrefined, dark matter instead of baking powder... In any case it would seem that this new 'recipe' caused the cakes to turn into horrible monsters that have overtaken my kitchen and infested the Clockworks` ([Total Caketastrophe! - Chaos in the Kitchen - Biscotti](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Total_Caketastrophe!/Chaos_in_the_Kitchen)).

We can suggest that those cakes are the result of _both_ dark matter and moonstone being introduced into the recipe: `He disappeared into the clockworks soon after Biscotti delivered the last crate of batter` ([A Gremlin in Knead](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Gremlin_in_Knead)). There no major examples of moonstone capable of causing a behavior reminiscent to dark matter. And, it is dark matter, which has identical behavior on non-hostile entities across other cases of its introduction, most reminiscent of [corrupted tortodrones]().

As no information is present in regards to Groat, apart from him disappearing into the Clockworks as peculiar (`He disappeared into the clockworks` - [A Gremlin in Knead](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Gremlin_in_Knead)) and the fact Creep Cakes with dark matter have infested the Clockworks, we lean into the idea of dark matter-based Creep Cakes invading Emberlight and by that time already possessing Groat. Those event were then later amplified by introduction of moonstone through actions of Dread Velvet possessing Groat.

As for Dread Velvet - it has a capacity to _inflict curse_, which is reminiscent of Darkfire Lord Vanaduke and Carnavons, as all of those are associated with dark matter. But, as far as we have analyzed properties of dark matter and its adjacent themes, we can derive 2 elements from Dread Velvet:

- Supposedly, introduction of dark matter is what gave rise to its consciousness and power over curse, distinct from other Creep Cakes.
- The dread naming convention here is tied to curse and its color, as Dread Velvet has a distinct pink color scheme.

Then Moonstone was added later by Groat in Emberlight's kitchen, which seemingly gave shock properties to those cakes, as well as an ability to power constructs.

Given later found elite knights near Groat fight, we can suggest, that those moonstone-empowered creep cakes have an ability to possess constructs. This ability is also found in the form of events revolving around Groat, as he was possessed by Dread Velvet, and as current cakes, as they are referred, possess retrodes, or [batterbots](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Retrode#Batterbot). In both cases damage to the host is required in order for the possessor to leave.

We have earlier discussed a correlation of moonstone and electricity, and, most present in relation to Quicksilver and a few other motifs.

##### Mineral Powder, Creep Cakes, and Sprite Food

The pattern of minerals being grinded to powder is present in several instances. As this property is focused upon in complex 357, we believe, the properties of minerals in this state - as dust, - serve an important role to the research within the complex, and potentially, contents of the [schematics]().

Given our [prior exploration of complex 357](), we have identified a few pools of minerals to which those are pumped with tubes. Nearby those pools usually is located a chamber, containing several discrete instances of minerals placed in proximity of 2 opposing gears - a design, which was observed norse-east of [Biscotti's kitchen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Total_Caketastrophe!/Chaos_in_the_Kitchen): [a small chamber with minerals and gears, and a tube nearby leading to a pool of dark matter](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Area-Total_Caketastrophe!-Chaos_in_the_Kitchen-2.png).

This design is most reminiscent of an industrial rotary shredder, which is relatively applicable to minerals in order to grind those into smaller peices.

The result of those minerals being grinded either to gel or powder is less explicitly direct due to the design of the output. There are not a few real-world minerals, which possess similar properties, such as electrical charge and paste-like texture, but, given current focus of dust, as a more common result, Biscotti's comment (`To speed up the process I may have used a teensy weensy bit of pure, unrefined, dark matter instead of baking powder...` - [Total Caketastrophe! - Chaos in the Kitchen - Biscotti](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Total_Caketastrophe!/Chaos_in_the_Kitchen)), presence of Battle Sprite foods named and depicted as dust seem to be a more concrete evidence of minerals to be grinded into dust, such as [Power Dust of Crimsonite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Power_Dust), [Shadow Dust of Dark Matter](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadow_Dust), and [Divine Dust of Luminite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Dust) - we believe those pools are representations of _mineral powder or grinded down mineral dust_. Those names suggest a link, which was established back in the first chapter of minerals fitting with specific concepts, such as rage or raw power, darkness, frenzy and wind, and, divinity of luminite.

If we attempt to extrapolate creation of Creep Cakes as _inanimate objects given sentience through dark matter_, where would those properties could have been applied within the context of high-secrecy military developments? And if so, what are the properties of other minerals when integrated as such medium into other creations, considering their descriptions?

##### Minerals and Souls: Part 4 - Conclusions, Isorans

As far as we are aware of the metaphysics of dark matter and minerals in general:

- Minerals can be placed into a tortodrone _to animate it as much as other charged minerals_, specifically, crimsonite, as it is powering uncorrupted tortodrones.
- There are instances of tortofist-derived weapons, which weaponize minerals' charge by _firing charged mineral rounds_, which capable of exploding.
- There are trojans, which we concluded to be an instance of different phenomenon - of _mineral forming through influx of curse_, with other instances being Carnavons and Lord Vanaduke.
- _Minerals' energy can bridge realms_ through specific placement adorned by fiedish sigils drawn of same mineral, consequently _summoning entities from underworld or banishing them from material realm_.
- Minearals power it can _protect from fiendish influence_.
- There is gremlin technology, which _allow minerals' power to be channeled to heal and revive_.
- With mineral glyphs can be made, which, when inscribed onto pages or form a text, _grant the object an aura_ and inner power.
- Minerals, when incorporated onto inanimate obejcts, _can grant sentience and life_.

Given those capabilites of minerals, the scope of effects can, of course, vary greatly. But, all of those characteristics follow a principle, which we have established as the [metaphysical stack](), - of energy flowing from the highest realm, manifesting in material realm in many variants, including the minerals, auras, souls, crystal and mist energy.

As if each strand of energy was by itself, when untied from physical medium, capable of traversing these realms. This energy, by staying and being amassed, then, is what allows for a soul, or sentience, to exsits - a notion established back during the [analyss of souls]().

It is also here we can finally suggest the precise physical nature of Isorans. Previously we have suggested that aura comprised the physical body of the soul, as both are tied together. Then we have proposed that Isorans, despite their looks, have a body of bones, identifying their species and ones of Almire as one. This proposal had led us to understand Isorans as corporeal entities with a skeletal structure, but with unknown composition of the rest.

Now, we propose, that, given the earlier revival system, Isorans are deeply tied to the nature of enargy, with their rest of bodies being as such - manifestations of auras, which are, as souls - energy.

##### Creep Cakes

In case of Creep Cakes, this seems to us to be a _more advanced application of the same case as dark matter and crimsonite were used to power tortodrones_.

Moonstone then, when introduced to Creep Cakes, allows for an elemental connection to electricity to be established, a theme, which was noted several times so far.

In terms of relation to Sprite Foods, given currently established nature of all 3, the progression from more common terms of mote to stone changes to orb and star in the tiers of sprite foods of the [Sprite Food Alchemy Machine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sprite_Food_Alchemy_Machine). This change from unrefined objects to more abstract shapes, seems us, as a symbolic element of a larger picture, which we are to explore soon enough.

#### Clockworks and Magitech

When speaking of Clockworks, inevitably, eventually, the Core and the Architect had to be brought up. Here we will attempt to parse Clockworks in the current state they are found in, working downwards from the most present in-game elements to ones that are less common.

##### Roarmulus Twins' Power Source

We begin with the [Storm Chaser](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Chaser), which as we remember was the Spark of Life before energy system rework (`The old ‚ÄòSpark of Life‚Äô crafting material has been renamed to 'Storm Chaser'` - [Release Notes: 2013.07.30](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2013-07-30)). Now it is important, that this update came after one which had introduced Roarmulus Twins: [Built to Destroy! 7-6-2011](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/14006), while the Voltedge was introduced in Blast Network update of [Release Notes 2011-08-02](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2011-08-02).

- The [Storm Chaser](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Chaser) is referenced in [Electron Vortex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Vortex) as a payload of unstable organic essence: `An Electron Bomb modified with a payload of unstable organic essence. Foes caught in its punishing radius are cruelly referred to as "thunderstuck"` ([Electron Vortex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Vortex)). Electron Vortex for the first time has appeared in the Blast Network update.
- [Storm Chaser](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Chaser) is then used in creation of [Voltedge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Voltedge): `Combining Spiral capacitor technology with samples recovered from the Ironclaw Munitions Factory produced the blade, which can output a particularly hazardous 1.21 gigawatt discharge`.

This would most likely mean, that __Roarmulus Twins' laser canons utilize Storm Chasers to power themselves__, as the material is the source of power for the blade, apart from which no other equivalent material was found.

This demonstrates the applied power of an elemental - and potentially, and even more importantly, - the potential of all 5-star essences, when we [had to discover and compare them againt fiendish glyphs]().

Due to this, we can extrapolate this concept onto [Red Roarmulus Twins](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Red_Roarmulus_Twins), by which they had to utilize [flame souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul), as a _fiery counterparts to shock_.

##### Blast Furnaces

More so, the suggestion of gremlins' application of flame souls across heavy industry is further affirmed by alchemy and description of [Combuster](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Combuster): `Combining the principles of the Skylark's engines with the technology powering the Blast Furnace produced this brutal blade, which can ignite even the most flame-retardant materials at a distance`. We can identify the technology powering Blast Furnaces through the analysis of the rest of alchemy line of Combuster: `An upgraded Brandish infused with the elemental essence of fire` ([Fireburst Brandish](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fireburst_Brandish)).

##### Battlepod Shielding

The only material which is added to this 3-star blade, compared to 2-star [Brandish](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brandish), is [Torchstone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torchstone): `A small rock that smolders constantly. Gremlins patrolling the Cooling Chambers occasionally use them as a hand warmer`. We can guess that it is a seemingly magic-infused material and one containing inner energy reminiscent of Fire Crystals or even minerals proper. It is also the one material used to transmute [Blazebreak Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blazebreak_Shield). [Blazebreak Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blazebreak_Shield) and [Blizzbreak Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blizzbreaker_Shield) are the only shield with _visible patterns as of breakable battlepod hexagonal shields_. Battlepod's shield are, notably, pink, which through the color scheme of the prior 2 transmutable shields, the way we see to be made with _dark matter_, as fiery variant of those shields is orange, as frost variant is light-blue.

This hexagonal pattern contrasts the impenetrable shielding of Roarmulus Twins, gremlin shields, battlepods, etc., which, as we have discussed in relation to [Roarmulus Twins and Ironwood](), is at least related to wood-derived properties, and on the latter end - to a more widespread usage of such materials for a common goal of shielding manufacture, be it devilites, empires of pre-Clockworks Cradle, or gremlins.

##### Cooling Chambers

As [Torchstone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torchstone) is used to transmute [Blazebreak Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blazebreak_Shield), so [Hailstone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hailstone) is used for [Blizzbreak Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blizzbreaker_Shield). [Hailstone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hailstone) same as its fiery counterpart, contains elemental energy, as suggested by the description of [Iceburst Brandish](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Iceburst_Brandish): `An upgraded Brandish infused with the elemental essence of ice`, - it is a 3-star upgrade to 2-star [Brandish](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brandish).

Iceburst Brandish is followed by 4-star [Blizzbrand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blizzbrand): `A high-tech blade that fuses Spiral and Clockwork Technology. It can produce a concentrated low-temperature explosion that is harmless to knights`, which is part of a similar in description line for brandishes. The material of the recipe is a [Perfect_Snowball](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Perfect_Snowball). Although we can argue, as it is also acquired for 10 [primal sparks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens), it a magical material, but potentially not a gremlin technology, although there are snow-themed Glinshlin clan of gremlins.

Compared to perfect snowball, there are other 4-star material in the alchemy tree of adjacent brandishes, ones are [Thunderball](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Thunderball): `An orb of pure electricity that is typically found at the bottom of the sea of all places` and [Blaze Pepper](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blaze_Pepper): `A delectable spice prized by Clockworks denizens of all sorts. In powdered form, it has a terrible habit of clinging to absolutely everything`, whose origins are currently vague.

4-star [Blizzbrand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blizzbrand) is upgraded then to [Glacius](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Glacius): `Mixing some advanced theories on cryogenics with the technology powering the Cooling Chamber produced this advanced armament, which is capable of flash-freezing the most formidable of foes`. New 5-star material is [Everfrost](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Everfrost), and the description of the blade `capable of flash-freezing the most formidable of foes` matches now [known powers of everfrost](). This, we believe, establishes __everfrost as an unnatural - one of Underworld origin, - cooling mechanism at the foundations of the cooling chambers__.

##### Power Complexes and Spiral Power Sources

Backing to [Blazebreak Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blazebreak_Shield) and [Blizzbreak Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blizzbreaker_Shield). The [Surge Breaker Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Surge_Breaker_Shield) introduces a greater importance of shock status within gremlin technological advancements. It is transmuted through introduction of 3-star [Volt Oil](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volt_Oil): `A slippery substance that always holds a slight electrical charge`.

Rather than being of gremlins' invention, Volt Oil is suggested to be Spiral Technology, in the description of [Kilowatt Pulsar](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kilowatt_Pulsar): `A Pulsar upgraded with Spiral technology to deliver an unpleasant shock on impact. Pulsar shots become more powerful the further they travel`. But, it is still elemental essence of lightning, as 3-star [Shockburst Brandish](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shockburst_Brandish) describes addition of Volt Oil: `An upgraded Brandish infused with the elemental essence of lightning`.

A 4-star upgrade, [Boltbrand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Boltbrand), introduces [Thunderball](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Thunderball): `An orb of pure electricity that is typically found at the bottom of the sea of all places`. Here we also can guess that this material - Volt Oil, - was initially identified by Spiral Order due to [Plasma Capacitor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plasma_Capacitor): `The addition of an advanced Spiral power source gives this bomb a shockingly large blast radius`, as it is a 4-star upgrade of [Lightning Capacitor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lightning_Capacitor): `An upgraded Capacitor that can explode with the fury of an electrical storm`. Despite it, the technology of large, weponized capacitors belong to gremlins - [Static Capacitor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Capacitor): `An explosive device of Gremlin origin designed to produce a deadly field of electricity`, which tells us of the _ability of Spiral Order to make advancements based on gremlin technology_.

It is here we can resolve the origin of [Thunderball](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Thunderball), as it is the new material and one refered as the `Spiral power source` ([Plasma Capacitor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plasma_Capacitor)). With this, [Blaze Pepper](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blaze_Pepper) and [Perfect Snowball](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Perfect_Snowball) seem to be also widespread natural occurances, not restricted to Cradle's ecosystem. Given Isoran focus on alchemy, the description of [Perfect Snowball](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Perfect_Snowball): `An icy snowball of almost mythical perfection. Though it begs to be thrown squarely into the side of someone's head, it would be best to use in alchemy`, is one we can veiw from the perspective of SPiral Order biotechs, utilizing its unique property in alchemy, - the __process which goes beyond physical nature of material, but rather utilizing their perception and themes to create tools__.

Within this context usage of [Thunderball](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Thunderball) in [Electron Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Bomb): `Adapted from several unconventional Gremlin theories on physics, anyone unlucky enough to be dragged into this bomb's blast is in for a shock`, - suggests that electron variant of graviton bomb is of Isroran origin, but, the description of [Electron Charge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Charge): `A small electro-explosive charge with mysterious origins. It is capable of generating a crippling vortex of electricity`, and its aquisition from King Krogmo devilites, we believe, counters this propsal, establishing __electron variant of the vortex as one of gremlin technology__, with the latter pattern of Spiral Order building upon the preexiting gremlin technology. WHile this is not stated in the descripton itself, compared to [Plasma Capacitor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plasma_Capacitor), the affiliation of Thunderball can still be seen as one related to isorans, while the device itself can be seen of gremlins' origin. Lastly, the [Electron Vortex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Vortex) is one to be `modified with a payload of unstable organic essence` ([Electron Vortex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Vortex)), which we have previously concluded to be Storm Chaser.

##### Spiral Order Modification of Pulsar

As with prior instance of Spiral Order modifying preexisting gremlin technology, such as electron charges and capacitors, shock-themed items, the pettern is observed also across pulsar alchemy tree. Most of their instances within the alchemy tree stem from Spiral Order research, as gremlins rarely mentioned. Yet, the original 2-star [Pulsar](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pulsar) is described as gremlin technology: `A high-tech Gremlin firearm originally designed for use by elite squads of Ironclaw soldiers` ([Pulsar](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pulsar)).

Herein, [Catalyzers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Catalyzer) contain seemingly the same underlying technology, judging by design of both weapon itself and its projectiles: `An advanced alchemical armament adapted from Gremlin mining and demolition devices. Catalyzer bullets envelop the enemy in an energy field that explodes after taking damage` ([Catalyzer](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Catalyzer)). Due to its projectiles looking essentially as moonstone versions of dark matter-themed Seerus's [Dark Retribution](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Retribution), we can confidently relate them to a single nature. Its also here we revisit [Electron Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Bomb) due to its similar pattern of orbiting spheres, although here they are not glowing, nor pulsing, - yet, as we have concluded it being of gremlin origin, this design pattern fits well with the _established design of particales as ones closely related to Underworld and gremlin technology_. Due to them looking similar, and the fact Dark Retribution and Arkus utilize the same type of projectiles, we suggest that those are connected by the supernatural nature and stem from a common principles of energy and souls, as ones seen in case of Lord Vanaduke in a lesser variant, _while abiding same orbital-themed movement patterns_. Given __our prior focus on graviton technology, as one attributed to Undercorp, this seems as no coincidence__, eseentially being a different application of `unconventional Gremlin theories on physics` ([Electron Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Bomb)).

As for rest of bombs, paralleling [Static Capacitor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Capacitor), those are all invented by Spiral Order, as all are described as alchemical bombs: [Shivermist Buster](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shivermist_Buster), [Venom Veiler](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Venom_Veiler), [Torpor Tantrum](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torpor_Tantrum), [Shivermist Buster](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shivermist_Buster), [Ash of Agni](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ash_of_Agni), [Stagger Storm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stagger_Storm): `Though it was originally developed by the Spiral Order to harmlessly subdue dangerous species, how you deal with foes unfortunate enough to be caught in the storm is entirely up to you` [Ash of Agni](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ash_of_Agni), the alchemical characteritic of those bombs seems intentional to propose those weapons stemming from alchemical expertize of Isorans.

The rest of catalyzer-derived weaponry includes toxic, even radioactive, [Toxic Catalyzer](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxic_Catalyzer): `A Catalyzer modified to fire dangerously radioactive projectiles. Catalyzer bullets envelop the enemy in an energy field that explodes after taking damage` and unmodified, less safe and less stable [Volatile Catalyzer](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volatile_Catalyzer): `Removing the safety overrides from a piece of Gremlin technology is a good way to lose a limb`. The latter seems to suggest that the original catalyzer is designed as gremlins intended, rather than being a Spiral Order modification. It is also here must be noted the extent of Spiral Order engineering, utmost demonstrated by [Virulent Catalyzer](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Virulent_Catalyzer): `The incorporation of Spiral technology has given this harrowing handgun a powerfully poisonous payload`, which marks [Corrosive Acid](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Corrosive_Acid): `A caustic substance characteristic of corrosive creatures`, as another material abiding to earlier principle of those being widespread enough for Isoans to discover them on their own. That is with the consideration of this gun being also radioactive, which provides further details on the specifics of Isoran combat strategies.

##### Magitech

To address the magic principle as the part of this section - [Magitech](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitech), - based on all of those uses of magic, elemental, materials, we can make a conclusion, that __gremlin civilization had utilized at Clockworks operational facilities__ _not only known physics_, __but magic elementals, graviton technology, and own elecricity-based innovations on top of graviton technology__.

It is the definition of the concept of Magitech, although one dependent on the definition of magic as concrete study. As for the cosmology, its vagueness in some of its aspects seems as a definitive application of the magitech concept, without presence of most discrete and concrete laws of the Universe, especially, its other realms, upon which megic phenomena are based.

In order to maintain Clockworks, several complexes are built across it:

- Blast furnaces of clockworks are built and used to melt raw planetary mass. They were built with the usage of _flame souls_.
- Cooling Chamber to maintain stability of its facilities, such as Power Complexes across the Clockworks, through application of _everfrost_.
- Power Complexes are used to wire and distribute energy of the Core across the Clockworks and to the surface, with _storm chasers being an essential element of this process_.
- Wasteworks were collecting residue from smelting and operation of Clockworks, given location's name. As there is an aspect of magic present at the industial scale, the residue would be likely, as well infused with unnatural properties, manifested as [Plague Essence](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plague_Essence): `A powerful essence left behind when a creature perishes from a particularly putrid disease`, and its followed attribution to the vile deity.

Lastly, there are skydomes mounted onto gear-like plates. Ths plates themselves are mounted onto large pillars seemingly comprising the structure of Clockworks, which may suggest that each of such pillars operates mostly through its own resources, apart from, of course, the enegry, which is most probable to be emited from the Core and distribuuted through Power Complexes.

##### Powered-down Clockworks

And yet, despite this guess of Clockworks engineering, the undead-themed depths of Clockwork tunnels, being the Haunted Passage, apart from being vaguely reminiscent of the Unknwon Passage with its regular design of tunnels and an intruder, has one peculiar design choice - __the skydomes nor Clockwork pillars are not lit__, - a pattern seen nowhere else, as even the Swarm within its most distinct observed presence within the skydome of the Unknown Passage, _has power, and in excess at that, given pink lightning arcs_, reminiscent of Power Complexes.

This allows us to suggest, that despite thematic difference from other undead locations - Graveyards and Owlite Academy, __Clockworks are influenced by the close presence of Underworld__, resulting in near-total shutdown of its sections, allowing only for its elevators to operate.

This theme reminds us of the unnatural darkness of Underworld, for the first time discussed proper in [relation to Apocrean realm](#analysis-of-apocrean-realm) and [Nefarious Imp]().

#### Weaponization of Undead

Given this context of Underworld-engulfed CLockworks, a speific type of undead had to be explored, seen and relating in particular to the [sealed Isoran vessel in the events of Ghost in the Machine]() - the [Static Dreadnoughts](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Deadnaught#Static_Deadnaught) and [Frankenzoms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frankenzom#Frankenzom).

Both of those seem to be manufactured, artificial entities, as we explore them. We start with [Frankenzoms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frankenzom#Frankenzom), as they may be seen as more of a gimmick, the dreadnoughts raise more question. As we have covered in the context of Graveyards, only Carnavons and Slug Walkers have a distinct armor, reminiscent of Almire.

Frankenzoms have, seemingly, _augmentations_ as the _metallic shoulder pads and electrcally wired pathways on the chest and spine_, as well as large mechanical bolts on the sides of the skull, reminiscent of ealier Frankenstein's monster cinematic designs possessing bolts at the base of the skull.

All [Bombies](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Surging_Bombie#Bombie) have a familiar [3-dot pattern](https://media3.spiralknights.com/wiki-images/7/70/Monster-Bombie.png), suggesting that they were artifically created, potentially of the same Iron Hulk, as it is most supernatural of all places relating to elecricity, even compared to the Power Complexes. But, those same bombies are seen in the areas, most remote, unaffectd by incorporation into Clockworks - those being Owlite Castles and, specifically, [Inner Sanctum](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Inner_Sanctum) of the [Necroplolis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire/Necropolis_Grounds). Given the excess presence of bombies there, practically uncountable, we can argue that those are the remnants of the Legion of Almire as the rest of enemies found there.

Presence of bombies in that context may be explained in 2 ways:

- Almire had already skill of weaponizing undead, which is unlukily given other information on Almire, as the kingdom is position as one unrelated to undeath, but its separate factions connected to Underworld deities, such being [Almirian graveyards with introduction of Vile deity]() and [Blackened Shrine with Magme Deity]().
- Creation of bombies is a later development. But, the source of this is conflicting, as on one hand we do have Clockwork technology, but on the other, there are traces of fiendish red ritual glyphs, found at [Necropolis Grounds](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire/Necropolis_Grounds), which may to a larer idea of how resurrection of the dead is perfomed on Cradle and through which means.

As far as bombies are encountered, we are leaning to the ide of them emerging as such through Underworld's presence, unties to a particular party inthe material realm. Those specifis of undead may be further affirmed by the phenomenon itself of Dreadnoughts.

#### Grim Totems: Part 2 - Undead Dreadnoughts

Finally, [Static Dreadnoughts](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Deadnaught#Static_Deadnaught) have unique, futuristic design of shoulder pads and arm guards same as other shock-themed undead discussed above. Those instances of [Static Dreadnoughts](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Deadnaught#Static_Deadnaught) are specific to Dry Docks' enclosure, but general presence of Dreadnoughts is not limited to this location, present also in all variants Firestorm Citadel.

Notably, it is the design of their shoulder pads which is similar to design pattern of 3-star pulsars, specifcally [Kilowatt Pulsar](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kilowatt_Pulsar), with its _2 vertical lines_ being present. More so, pulsars' drawn patterns seem to suggest a symbolic application depending on the utilized element or status effect.

So, all Dreadnoughts have an armor, the Almirian Guards even have proper crusader armor. While this factor was important in relation to our proposal of nature of zombies as Isorans, Dreadnoughts still remain as ones _far surpassing any living species in their scale_, more associating with giants than anyone else - an idea, that was suggested when we had inspected [Ancient Plate Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Armor): `A suit of artifact armor that is said to have been worn by titans. Though it offers amazing protection, its incredible weight makes it cumbersome to wear`.

But, apart from their scale, one common element allows us to understand the nature of dreadnoughts, - their ability to ressurect recently fallen undead as long as periched undead's skull remains intact. This requires us to analyse grim totems now _with all knowledge of current metaphysics in attempt to properly define this power of resurrection_.

By its nature, grim totem is a mechanism most likely originating from the Underworld, as discussed ealier, based on stone-like design with accent on purple energy and incorporation of faces.

The principle behind the resurrection, through observation, is one of a visible wave of purple energy, which, as it propagates over an area, resurrects recently deceased undead from their skulls and reconstructing their bodies.

If we also refer to the idea of spirits returning to material realm on Cradle, we may operate in terms of spirit leaving and returning to the corpe, [haunting it](), allowing ressurection to happen.

As zombies emerge from the graves only as a living being passes nearby them, we may suggest that the souls are not present up to that moment in time. We know, based on instances of Lost Souls, that those are attracted to the living [ones the souls are released proper]().

Could it be, that the same phenomenon happens in regards to graveyards and other instances of undead reacting to presence of the living, such cases being the Phantoms of graveyards and Grimalkin across the Candlestick Keep? This proposal would fit within our operational framework.

Across cultures, it is variable when the soul leaves the body, and in case of our cosmology, we have seen instances of soul leaving instantly - as when Lord Vanaduke was defeated, - with his body remaining and the traces of his [soul with curse being linger within the armor - as finery]().

In case of zombies, presence of a soul is characterized by glowing eyes. And then there are skulls themselves, which in a few instances form an aura around, suggesting haunting. Yet, the are no auras for zombies, but present for phantoms.

This distinction, we believe, while is important, states a characteristic presence of a soul within the skull. But, the energy emission of the totem does not affect dreadnoughs themselves. More so, the ressurected zombies do not contain heat - a shared property with the Void monsters emerging from Swarm sources. As we don't yet know nature of heat, it should be a speculation - _to assume, that the resurrected lack souls_.

Instead, we can attempt to explain it from the _perspective of other devilite technology_ - the cases being of a soul-energy motif:

- Fiendish glyphs, whose operation is of data and energy storage. The latter application is essential for operation of grim gates, which tap into teleportation and transportation over realms.
- Usage and storage of souls undefinitely in everfrost.
- Detection of living beings by monster doors.
- Corrupted tortodrones bieng powered by power of dark matter mineral, as they were directly disassembled to allow dark matter crystal to be placed.
- Dark matter crystal of trojans being a vulnerable and essential for their survival, being a conduit for their power.

Those factors, this motif of dark matter and energy being tethered together in order to power entities and machinery, we propose, had to be present for all fiendish technology and methodology.

At the same time, that is a case of Blackened Shrine, which is most likely a fiendish device, as suggested by [magma cult]() and [our exploration of this culture](). The shrine has bound Lord Vanbaduke's soul to the body, transforming the latter. Compared to this, grim totem only resurrects, but does not transform, albeit it is seen only being used on undead, rather than fiends or the living.

With this, we propose that it is not the soul which is rebound to a corpse, but __its traces being empowered by emitted dark energy__.

This dark energy is then had to be emitted from a source, and this source is contained also in dreadnoughs.

While for grim totems it is mostly unknwon, dreadnoughs possessing same power ties with their nature. We have previously suggested the mythological, which transition into pop-culture, inpirations. And we can derive from this notion more information.

An application of an pop-cultural concept and a spirit of Japanese mythology - Gashadokuro. The key element here is the ability to assemble themselves from the bones of improperly buried, which is fitting for Almire's setting, as well as the general theme of spirits returning to the material realm. As for their armor, we suggest it being of the same phenomenon as Lord Vanaduke's armor, of supernatural origin. We can also male a guess, that the fact dreadnoughts are presented in front of tiles of bones in the Overgrown Court of Shadowplay, we can link those two.

<BookCitation source="Yokai.com, the illustrated database of Japanese folklore, Gashadokuro">
  {#snippet markup()}

  Soldiers whose bodies rot in the fields and victims of famine who die unknown in the wilderness rarely receive proper funerary rites. Unable to pass on, their souls are reborn as ghosts, longing eternally for that which they once had. These people die with anger and pain in their hearts. That energy remains long after their flesh has rotted from their bones. As their bodies decay, their anger ferments into a grudge against the living, which twists them into a supernatural force. When the bones of hundreds of victims gather together into one mass, they form the humongous, skeletal monster known as the gashadokuro.

  Too large and powerful to be killed, gashadokuro maintain their existence until the energy and malice stored up in their bodies has completely burnt out. However, because of the large amount of dead bodies required to form a single one, these abominations are rarer today than they were in the past, when wars and famine were a part of everyday life.

  {/snippet}
</BookCitation>

We propose, this exact __grudge against the living is the reanimating force, which makes surrounding dreadnough undead to be resurrected__. This suggestion not only further contextualizes undead Almire, but suggests, that their fate is still undetemined, as it will be proven by exitsnce of Shadow Firestorm Citedal, discussed earlier.

In relation to the grim totems, as much as metaphysics of curse and souls we were concerned with, energy of a soul, and in case of dreadnoughts, supposedly, multiple souls, it is the explanation for the nature of purple or dark energy observed in grim totems.

#### Ghost Blocks, Eyes, and Energy

Ghost blocks possess several unique to Clockworks' environemnt properties, starting from a carved on their near surface sumbol of an eye. Initially found on the Collector and then on the ghost blocks themselves, the symbol is of a familiar eye, usually attributed to Underworld and curse. But, as far as we have discussed appearances of the eye, the context of ghost blocks, even in the color scheme itself, differs drastically.

Even more so, the _emanating light from the ghost block's top is most reminiscent of the depiction of the Core_ in its many depictions with colors white and blue, with particles of burning. It is one of two objects, which possess a counterpart within the Core, the [other being an explosive sphere]().

Yet, as mineral blocks, ghost blocks seem to be made of crude material, reminiscent of stone.

The face of the block itself - the emblem, - given its design of an open radiating top, we believe, is designed as such to __link the emblem, its a glowing iris of the same color as the light, to the source of said light__. The only time we see directly an association of an eye with energy, is, of course, the Swarm and its many depictions both in the Core and outside of it, as well as its craving for Core's energy. This pattern is to be kept in mind.

As for the function of the block - it makes surrounding blocks to disappear in an uncharacteristic to most Clockworks technology manner - _by phasing out of existence in a purple-blue flash of light_. So far, the only matter which is capable of such capabilities is the whitespace blocks from within the Core - as it had appeared, albeit in a white glow, from an empty space both during the events of [Dreams and Nightmares](), and the [Unknown Passage]().

At that point we have to keep in the first concept, which might allow to establish greater connection - of a cascading effect, - which is something suggested by large-scale effects of a single ghost block. As we have previously observed a similar phasing effect in phantom-like entities, such as Black Kats, and, by extension, Black Kat Seraphynx, this motif can be phrased as a __capacity of phase out from the material realm at a large scale, related to nature of Whitespace of the Core__. The name of ghost block may in time reaveal more information of the _nature of Whitesapce itself and physical priciples of its operation_.

Then there is a concept of _pairing eyes to energy_, with an iris being an important element to linking the two, which we will keep a track of once we gat to the analysis of the Core and all of accompanying it entities.

#### Alchemy Stations, Orbs of Alchemy and Alchemical Transmutation

As it was stated earlier, electricity seems to be regarded as one of more important aspects of Clockworks' design, up to the point of its presence as lightnings above the Core at depth 29, as well as within the Unknown Passage, wherein same arcs of lightning are now integrated into the nature of the Swarm. Lightnings and abundance of power is predominantly focused within Power Complexes.

Power Complexes are populated by shock-themed enemies, including quicksilver lichens. Quicksilver in alchemy was often associated with the concept of the Prima Materia, and represented the soul. The dual nature of mercury, which is essentially quicksilver, - both a liquid metal and a toxic substance, - has contributed to its symbolism in alchemy, representing both transformation and danger.

This points us to further presence of dualities within Clockworks. Alchemists of western cultures sought to understand and manipulate these transformative properties in their quest for the philosopher's stone and the secrets of creation of matter and achieving immortality. Following this idea of alchemical symbolism and prior knowledge of magitech motifs, we can make an educated guess on the nature of energy. As we have proposed, energy is derived from the Nameless Realm and energy was associated with the concept of salt through its symbolism. Salt, in alchemy, in one of its many interpretation, is one of three primes. Essentially, it is one of elements from which all of matter is built. Yet, the more prominent idea of energy as omnipresent in its different forms relates to a concept in alchemy of Prime Matter.

Here we should note on the _widespread presence of alchemy stations across Cradle and Clockworks_. Their design, evident by two-layered frame below the display, is of Clockworks rather than of Spiral Order, - designed by gremlins and then used by Stgrangers and Isorans.

We have previously proposed, that the concept of energy and later of Spiral is a universal constant. This way we explained seemingly unrelated presence of energy, or salt, and symbol on both Isoran and Valkyrian armors. Through the identification of Forgotten time, we have suggested a deeper relation between Isorans and celestial beings, which were potentially Owlites.

Then there was symbol of orbs of alchemy or of the alchemy, - of transmtation, itself. As it is depicted on modern alchemy station and tomes of rage, descending from valkyries to a time of existing dragons, we suspect it being a universal phenomenon. Then there is __Sanctuary Alchemy Station, which is explicitly designed with this symbol crowning the device__, _instead of depicting it on the display_.

Given our notion of applying alchemical interpretaton, we suggest, that _Orbs of Alchemy are philosopher's stones, as they serve as the catalyst for the transmutation itself_. But, their origins remains unknown, as they are uncraftable, with the a few ways of their aquition being discovery across Clockworks or a purchase for energy in Supply Depot.

The prior scenario presumes their existnce before Isorans or even Strangers, and given context of Sanctuary Alchemy Station, we are leaning to either them being devised by gremlins, or being a part of a greater scheme. The latter scenario requires elabortation - and that is mostly due to presence of the same symbol for civilizations which we rulled out to be not related to Clockworks, but with the Sleeper - a [deific entity, and a benefactor f heavenly kingdom]. With this, Orbs of Alchemy seem more of a universal constant - an essential element to existence and operaton of alchemy and transmutation.

Here, we have to look also at the design of Orbs of Alchemy, Specifically, their golden frame as one _reminiscent of Cradle's arm, seemingly being contained in a mechanical frame_. The interior of alchemy orbs is of bright lights, whose amount increases depending on the star rarity of the orb. We will return to the themes of gold in relation to alchemy and nature of Whitespace.

#### Prima Materia, The First Matter

We continue with the alchemical symbolism of the Energy, being the prime matter, first matter, the Prima Materia.

Here we will quote english translation of Carl Jung's "Psychology and Alchemy" as it is paramount to everything below and around depth 29 of Clockworks.

<BookCitation source="Psychology and Alchemy - Carl Jung">
    {#snippet markup()}

    The basis of the opus, the prima materia, is one of the most famous secrets of alchemy. This is hardly surprising, since it represents the unknown substance that carries the projection of the autonomous psychic content. It was of course impossible to specify such a substance, because the projection emanates from the individual and is consequently different in each case. For this reason it is incorrect to maintain that the alchemists never said what the prima materia was; on the contrary, they gave all too many definitions and so were everlastingly contradicting themselves. For one alchemist the prima materia was quicksilver, for others it was ore, iron, gold, lead, salt, sulphur, vinegar, water, air, fire, earth, blood, water of life, lapis, poison, spirit, cloud, sky, dew, shadow, sea, mother, moon, dragon, Venus, chaos, microcosm.

    Besides these half chemical, half mythological definitions there are also some ‚Äúphilosophical‚Äù ones which have a deeper meaning. Thus in the treatise of Komarios we find the definition ‚ÄúHades.‚Äù In Olympiodorus the black earth contains the ‚Äúaccursed of God‚Äù (Œ∏ŒµŒøŒ∫Œ±œÑŒ¨œÅŒ±œÑŒøœÇ). The ‚ÄúConsilium coniugii‚Äù says that the father of gold and silver‚Äîi.e., their prima materia‚Äîis ‚Äúthe animal of earth and sea,‚Äù or ‚Äúman,‚Äù or a ‚Äúpart of man,‚Äù e.g., his hair, blood, etc.

    The unfettered opposites in chaos. ‚ÄúChaos‚Äù is one of the names for the prima materia. The mercurial dragon of Greek alchemy, surnamed ·ºïŒΩ œÑ√≤ œÄ·æ∂ŒΩ gave rise to descriptions of the prima materia as Unum, Unica Res, and Monad and to the statement in the ‚ÄúLiber Platonis quartorum‚Äù that man is well qualified to complete the work because he possesses that which is simple, i.e., the soul. Mylius describes the prima materia as the elementum primordiale. It is the ‚Äúpure subject and the unity of forms,‚Äù and in it any form whatsoever may be assumed (in quo retinetur quaelibet forma cum possibilitate).

    The autonomy and everlastingness of the prima materia in Paracelsus suggest a principle equal to the Deity, corresponding to a dea mater.

    [It] clearly show that the alchemists came to project even the highest value‚ÄîGod‚Äîinto matter. With the highest value thus safely embedded in matter, a starting-point was given for the development of genuine chemistry on the one hand and of the more recent philosophical materialism on the other, with all the psychological consequences that necessarily ensue when the picture of the world is shifted 180 degrees. However remote alchemy may seem to us today, we should not underestimate its cultural importance for the Middle Ages. Today is the child of the Middle Ages and it cannot disown its parents.

    The prima materia has the quality of ubiquity: it can be found always and everywhere, which is to say that projection can take place always and everywhere. The English alchemist Sir George Ripley (c. 1415‚Äì90) writes: ‚ÄúThe philosophers tell the inquirer that birds and fishes bring us the lapis, every man has it, it is in every place, in you, in me, in everything, in time and space.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt offers itself in lowly form [vili figura]. From it there springs our eternal water [aqua permanens].‚Äù According to Ripley the prima materia is water; it is the material principle of all bodies, including mercury. It is the hyle which the divine act of creation brought forth from the chaos as a dark sphere. The chaos is a massa confusa that gives birth to the stone. The hylical water contains a hidden elemental fire. In the treatise ‚ÄúDe sulphure‚Äù hell-fire (ignis gehennalis) is attributed to the element earth as its inner opposite. According to Hortulanus, the stone arises from a massa confusa containing in itself all the elements. Just as the world came forth from a chaos confusum, so does the stone.

    The idea of the rotating aquasphere reminds us of the Neopythagoreans: in Archytas the world-soul is a circle or sphere; in Philolaos it draws the world round with it in its rotation. The original idea is to be found in Anaxagoras, where the nous gives rise to a whirlpool in chaos. The cosmogony of Empedokles is also relevant: here the œÉœïŒ±ƒ´œÅŒøœÇ (spherical being) springs from the union of dissimilars, owing to the influence of œïŒπŒªŒØŒ±. The definition of this spherical being as, ‚Äúthe most serene God,‚Äù sheds a special light on the perfect, ‚Äúround‚Äù nature of the lapis, which arises from, and constitutes, the primal sphere; hence the prima materia is often called lapis. The initial state is the hidden state, but by the art and the grace of God it can be transmuted into the second, manifest state. That is why the prima materia sometimes coincides with the idea of the initial stage of the process, the nigredo. It is then the black earth in which the gold or the lapis is sown like the grain of wheat. It is the black, magically fecund earth that Adam took with him from Paradise, also called antimony and described as a ‚Äúblack blacker than black‚Äù (nigrum nigrius nigro).

    {/snippet}
</BookCitation>

From here stems the idea of Mercurius, standing on the round chaos, holding the scales which signify the pondus et mensura. The rotundum is a prefiguration of the gold.

Known as the alchemical Void, the Prima Materia, at its base form being the Void, and Energy, one which is present in everything across material realm, as shown by Sparks of Life and [Silkwing healing powers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silkwing#Silkwing). Concentration of raw energy drastically amplifies vitality of everything that it surrounds, as evident by the Core's influence, up to if not limited to the transformation of battle sprites. Those alchemical concepts should be kept in mind, as a few elements of gremlin society remain.

#### King Tinkinzar

King Tinkinzr, as a figure, is deeply related to the nature and origin of Crimson Order and foundation of Clockworks as a megastructure. If we approach this relation from Herex's point of view, one of deep despise towards the order: `The Nine are blind, they cannot see the Truth that lies below. The Nine are deaf, they cannot hear the Resonance that beats within this world` ([Spark and Roar - Hidden Hideout - Danger Module - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Danger_Module:_Hidden_Hideout)) we observe an inversion of what Seerus says in the Engines of War: `The Nine see all, hear all` - a relation of the Order to sences of sight and hearing. Than Seerus states: `King Tinkinzar alone upholds the Iron Law!` which makes, we suspect, an accent on both on the importance of the figure of the king, and a role of hands. Those phrases are found at the monitors with the imagery of Crimson Order symbol. This design pattern, as well as the [analysis of Iron Law](), is reminiscent of Big Brother of "1984" by George Orwell and his quotes, depicted on the telescreens.

As it was previously pointed out: `Tinkinzar is said to be a great ruler and mechanical genius, responsible for the vision of the whole Clockworks` ([Bootshuze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Bootshuze)) - it frames Tinkinzar as an embodiment of a particular trope - [the philosopher king](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhilosopherKing), a scientist-king, and here, implied creator of Clockworks, which are, by the factor of scale and greater entities at play, is the definition of megastructure with cosmic horror at hand.

Then there is the symbolysm of Iron Law and Great Colony's embelm, already covered, but in acurrent context requiring alaboration. While the bolt is held within the teech of a wrech is a subject of symbolic interpretation of an iron grip on gremlins ideology, on the contrary, there is Crimson Throne itself and Crimson Order insignia, which has only a single depiction of a wrench proper, in both cases not tighting the bold, but present within the gear, a less enforcing imagery, even suggesting a duality of both, as one requires the other for the metaphorical machine to operate.

There, teeth of the gear are generally accepted as being members of the Crimson Order, while the wrench, we suggest, is the king himself, evident by imagery of same wrench on Seerus's Crimson Throne. This depiction, we believe, is not a manner of Seeus's character, but an attribution of a member of Crimson Order at his own facility, a nobility of an order within a kingdom.

Those similarities, as well as the implied longevity and a supposed benevolence of king Tinkinzar in contrast with the realities of gremlin civilization had initially lead us to the conclusion of concept of a great gremlin king being engineered specifically by Crimson Order, if we work strictly from lack of any physical evidence of his existence. But, the symbolism at absence of physical evidence is what we were operating through the analysis, as symbols' consistency is one which may allow encoded within concept to resurface.

We would have concluded at that, if not for the existence of the Architect:

`IN HIS MADNESS, THE ARCHITECT BETRAYED THE PACT. TWISTING HIS CREATION INTO A GAME OF DEATH, IT NOW DEVOURS ALL WHO ENTER ITS IRON EMBRACE.` ([Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Artifact)).

More notions arise from notes of the Alpha Squad by framing Clockworks in the similar manner from the perspective of not an abstrct entity, but Isorans: `This is a world designed to confuse its travelers. It wants to trap and destroy them. I'm starting to think its like a cat, toying with its prey before delivering the final blow` ([Recon Module: Ironclaw Munitions Factory - Rulen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Artifact)).

Due to total absence of any entity remotely reminiscent of the Architect, apart from abstraction of the Swarm, but one which is not Sleeper itseffl, the single and only lead we see is that the Architect is king Tinkinzar.

With this in mind, with the idea of Great Colony, and Iron Law, we can attempt to guess the logic behind the Artifact and Consoles deeper role based on the design element of the two and a relation to the Core at a symbolic and thematic level.

#### Consoles: Part 2 - Divine Clockworks and Whitespace

The Artifact and Consoles are connected by the fact of working, as far as direct observation suggest, as a key and a lock. Yet, to understand this relation and its precise effects, we are required to be aware of the designs of Whitespace, of what distinguishes it from the rest of depths in greatest detail. We will perform this analysis in multiple iterations, looking as the entire system's elements.

First, 3 new concepts are introduced by Whitespace, one that is most certainly located within the Core during the events of [Dreams and Nightmares](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_nightmares):

- Existence of White Clockwork or Whitespace Clockwork tunnels at the start of the [Step Beyond](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/A_Step_Beyond), a platform, reminiscent of the beginning of the [Unknown Passage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Unknown_Passage):

  - Both platform have similar proportions: 9 tiles width, and 9 tiles depth, whitespace version has 10 tiles depth.
  - Both versions have 4x4 4 Clockworks tunnel pillars on each angle of the main platform.
  - Through the border of the platform goes a single pipe.
  - But, Unknown Passage's platform has 3 paths extending from it, white Whitespace has only a single path obscured by the different material comprosed of physical Whitespace matter.

- Transition from the design of Clockwork tunnels to an abstract shapes of cubes of Whitespace proper.

  - It partially reminds of the design choice present in the Unknown Passage, as portion of the tunnel was destroyed, Whitespace forms, the cubes, filled it in order for knight to pass over the gap.

_White Clockwork tunnels are seen only once outside of the Core_ - in the [Divine theme](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Theme_(Guild_Hall)) of the Guild Hall. It is the last and most expensive upgrade, requiring most of the Guild Hall to be unlocked and active. This connection - of Whitespace theme being referred as the divine, - __establishes a relation between the nature of divine color scheme and divine implications of Whitespace__. This statement will be the foundation for our further analysis. But, on its own it could've been written off as an asset reuse, a case we were encountering a few time for now.

Instead, our investigation of Nameless Realm and other deific figures from the other chapters, which revolve around Owlites, becomes relevant. Particularly, it is the nature of heavenly kingdom, also identified as the paradise, whose role was important in relation to Fallen Valkyrean is what interests us _as a preestablished metaphysical system prior to arrival of gremlin empire_. Of all of the experiences of the divine for Owlites and Valkyries, nature of the paradise and of heavenly kingdom is [one we have suggested to be a precursor for existence of Whitespace within the Core]() as both possess a dintinct deific features, and _offer a resolution for a later question of inception or discovery of the Sleeper by gremlins_.

Now, keeping this paradigm in mind, as proper identification of Whitespace requires us to keep track both of _classical, mythologic motifs_ established in relation to heavenly kingdom, and now _alchemical motifs_ of gremlins of modern period of time in general.

For the most part, divine-themed equipment is related to heavenly kingdom. But the difference here arises from the particular colors, as monochrome and occasional gold of Whitespace is not attributed to the divine color scheme. A more fitting connection through monochromatic pattern is attributed to the [Grey Prise Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Prize_Box). So far we are only concerned with a peculiarity of grey as one containing all of battle sprites in this form, disregaeding their origin.

Grey prize box contains replicas of every accessory. This pattern is similar to the white Clockworks in the Core, with an addition of [grey aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Aura#Grey_Aura), which darkens the surroundings. We have the explanation behind this design, but it requires understanding role of the Swarm first, which will be discussed soon.

One more element of the grey prize box in particular is the [silver personal color](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silver_Personal_Color#Silver_Personal_Color), as silver is the heavenly metal within this cosmology - as [Sun Silver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Silver): `An extraordinary metal imbued with the radiant light of the sky`, and the [Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore): `An extremely rare metal of great power said to be from the heavens above`, - relating back to the celestials, supposed Owlites.

Silver, by nature of the name, is associated with Sun Silver - a gold-like material, and yet, here silver is monochrone, and appears even in a correspondinng, _colorless_ prize box. A note must be made here on the pure grey design of non-prismatic elements of [Heavenly iron Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Helm) which is transmuted with the introduction of the [Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore), but itself, is moslty lacks color.

The third design concept found in Whitespace is of the __square spiral__. As in case of the [first introduction](#concept-of-spiral) of this form, we are searching for patterns:

- Walkways of the Step Beyond depths have transitory square spiral patterns.
- Patterns of square spirals present on the gates - enemy gates and golden key gates.

  The prior, notably, has image of an eye with significantly larger iris and pinkish purple color, reminiscent of curse more than Swarm's pink.

- Square spiral pattern is also observed across [Mysterious Consoles and the Artifact](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Artifact). It will be the point of the further analysis.

Then, outside of the Core, bur relating to it, there are 3 main elements to the console itself: the display, a platform, and a slot for the Artifact, evident by a placement of 2 vertical rods of the Artifact.

The notable element of the console, which, we believe, is a solid proof of Console's gremlin origin, is the design of the console below the display. It is a curved structure of metal with internal components of dark metal and external plating of more bright color. And exactly on the latter, _on each side of the console, there are 3-stub ends placed in a radial shape with a circled hole below_. __It is the exact design of the Clockwork elevators__ - each side of which contains that exact design up to the inner and outer plating. Except for the color of the outer plating is more contrast. There are brass components of the grid floor of the console, which hold the wires. Color of those elements is the same as the component of the same design around the moving Clockwork elevators' platform.

Ironwork-like designs on the outer and inner circles of the console's platform surrounding the grid and the pattern the Artifact's lid are similar - __the very square spiral, is the Greek key__ - a part of the more general meander pattern. Greek key specifically was found across _Greek and Roman architecture_. With this, now we can now look for shared patterns in attempt to fill in whitespaces in gremlin civilization's history.

Due to utmost proximity of Consoles' design to the Whitespace, we can gather that this design has greater importance to gremlin civilization, or at least, its inner party, such as Crimson Order, as nowhere else any symbolic element is present apart of Crimson Order insignia itself or the gremlin emblem. More so, the _mirroring of reality outside of the Core within the Whitespace_, and concept of mirrors in general, is one we are tracking since identification of a [motif of dreaming both for Apocrea and Sleeper]() as two thematic opposites, yet being similar in that regard.

The last components of the console are the display itself and slot for the artifact. While there is not much, currently, in regards to the slot Artifact is placed in, the display as well as the Artifact's lid contain symbols, which we will identify as gremlin written language.

#### Gremlin Conlang

Based on the encountered instances of gremlin written language, or rather their written system, we will use for the description of those symbols in this document [unicode block symbols](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode/blocks/block-elements/). Those symbol are encountered in 3 instances - _Console_ with the _Artifact_, and the _Roarmulus Twins_.

The important thing is to establish is how to transcribe them, - does the dark element of the square fill the letter, or it is the white form we are looking for? To solve this, e have to look at physical letters. One such instance is on the side of the lid, covering the Artifact during activation - those symbols, judging by the lightning, are located in front of the darker elements. We consider this as the guide.

Then there is the direction in which those symbols are read. As console screen depicts rows as, likely, notations to the pulse flow from left to right, we can guess that the gremlin conlang is written horizontally from left to right. But the instance of the console screen does not tell of what are the symbols there - as we can consider the white squared as background, or as part of letters. To solve it, we appeal to the earlier case of symbols on the inner plate layer of the lid of the Artifact clot container, as there, there would be no need to carve with such intricacy the individual blocks.

- This, we believe, leads us to interpret the white background as if the color is inverted, meaning that the patter of the symbol is black.
- The same logic is then applied to the row of 3 symbol on the container's lid - reading there only black patterns.
- On the other inner metal plate on the horizontal dimension of the lid we look for white pattern on black background.
- The Roarmulus Twins' symbols are the black patterns

<div class="code-conlang">

As a result, we get the following symbols:

- Console
  - Console screen
    - Leftmost section
      - `‚ñù` `‚ñÑ` - a pulse line extends from this row
      - `‚ñÑ` `‚ñò` `‚ñü`
      - `‚ñû` `‚ñó` `‚ñå` - a pulse line extends from this row
      - `‚ñü` `‚ñù` `‚ñó` `‚ñù`
      - `‚ñÄ` `‚ñÑ` `‚ñò` - a pulse line extends from this row
    - Pulse line annotations
      - `‚ñù` `‚ñö` `‚ñà` `_` `‚ñõ`
      - `‚ñò` `‚ñü` `‚ñò` `‚ñÑ` `‚ñå`
      - `‚ñà` `‚ñó` `‚ñÄ` `‚ñô` `‚ñù` - positioned above rightmost pulse line
    - Rightmost section
      - `‚ñó` `‚ñÄ` `‚ñÑ`
      - `‚ññ` `‚ñü` `‚ñå`
      - `‚ñê` `‚ñû` `‚ñà`
    - Energy pips. Those are located in a lower half of the holographic interface and depict:
      - Below the leftmost section Cradle infographic with the Moon and the Arm, with pip depicting a flow from top to bottom.
      - Below rightmost section the Artifact infographic with distinct 3 circles is seen. Flow of pips is seen to go from bottom to top.
  - Artifact Container Lid
    - `‚ñó` `‚ñÄ` `‚ñô` - side of the lid, engraved on the outer metal plate layer
    - `‚ñà` `_` `‚ñõ` `‚ñó` `‚ñÄ` - Side of the lid is mirrored on both sides retaining its orientation. This means, that one of the readings - a side upon which it is read, is incorrect. Since the previous line is not symmetrically places, we will consider this orientation as correct.
    - The last text is on top of the lid, and it is as large as the console screen text. In fact, it is the same image, all of the lines from the console screen are appended to the leftmost block's last line.
- Artifact

  All of its 3 circles have the same pattern. We will looks for the black symbols on light background.

  `x` - marks lack of circle's surface

  `_` - marks lack of light on the surface

  The result is: `x` `‚ñÄ` `x` `‚ñê` `‚ñû` `‚ñà` `‚ñó` `x` `x` `‚ñü` `x` `‚ññ` `_` `‚ñå` `‚ñÑ` `x`

- Roarmulus Twins

  - Marking pointing to the right eye and the foundation with an arrow: `‚ñÄ`

    Due to lack of space above the block, we can conclude that is only symbol possible to fit. And, due to to presence of a next line on the armor plate, we will read it in the same direction.

  - Arrows pointing to armor plates' joints: `_` `‚ñÄ` `‚ñü` `‚ñà` `‚ñå` `‚ñå`

    There are several issues with this transcription:

    - The last 2 repeating symbol is an uncommon pattern.
    - We can gather, that the `‚ñà` is incorrect, which will lead followed symbols to be interpreted incorrectly. There is a possibility of `‚ñê` being present.
    - But the one to last symbol has vertical side with a pit, followed to the left exactly as the width of `‚ñå`, leaving the questionable symbol on the left, as one similar to triangle. No such symbol is seen anywhere else.
    - The last symbol, due to lack of boxes, could be as `‚ñå` as `‚ñê`. So, due to this, we have to operate on those symbol with a possibility of error inherited in the transcription.

    This line is found in multiple instances, always pointing to a point of 2 plates connecting, which might five a hint to its meaning.

  Notably, the texture of the Roarmulus Blueprints has all metal notches depicted as on the Twins themselves.

Based on this, we can arrange a table of repetitions of each symbol:

<center>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Symbol / Rune</th>
        <th>Repetitions (min/max)</th>
        <th>Quardrants / 4-bit value</th>
        <th>Hexadecimal number</th>
        <th>Decimal number</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><em>Unicode symbol</em></td>
        <td><em>Amount of times encountered, the min value is the confident response, the max value is probable</em></td>
        <td><em>Bits are derived in order: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right</em></td>
        <td><em>Hexadecimal number derived from 4-bit value representations of quadrants</em></td>
        <td><em>Decimal number derived from 4-bit value representations of quadrants</em></td>
      </tr>
      {#each GREMLIN_CONLANG_RUNES as runeInfo, ri}
        <tr class={ri % 2 == 0 ? 'row-color-1' : 'row-color-2'}>
          {#each runeInfo as infoElement, i}
            {#if i == 0}
              <td><code>{infoElement}</code></td>
            {:else}
              <td>{infoElement}</td>
            {/if}
          {/each}
        </tr>
      {/each}
    </tbody>
  </table>
</center>

</div>

Mention of gremlin cryptography in the Aftermath: `It'll take forever to decipher gremlin cryptography` ([Operation Crimson Hammer - Aftermath]), may be related to this language.

But the presented instances of the language, we believe, seemingly being encrypted, as in case of Roarmulus twins, they serve as markings on the joints of armor plates; and in case of Mysterious Console and Artifact, they seem to be operational instructions or a manual, as they are present both on top of the lid and in the holographic display, serving functional purpose - and, seemingly, infographic one.

The other, more probable case of those symbols being __native written form of gremlin language__.

We come to this conclusion based on the aforementioned context of symbols' placement, as those location are not likely to be intentionally encrypted, but rather seem to be a simple language barrier.

In fact, there is one more case of a language barrier during the events of [Operation Greenhorn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Breaking_in_the_Recruits/Operation_Greenhorn). In the Strangers' town, likely Haven, gremlins have a different pattern of speaking: `Greetings, little. One. Don't step. On snipes`, `Greetings. Get Shinies. Get Shinies`, `Snipes. Buy? Sell?` ([Strangers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Breaking_in_the_Recruits/Operation_Greenhorn)).

The existence of a language barrier in the latter case suggests, that there is at least one other language within gremlin society, potentially, in conjunction with a low literacy level within gremlin society, given its more grim themes, paired with wide presence of, at least, militaristic motifs.

Notably, low literacy level was encountered one other time, in relation to an undead Kat Tribe: `It appears that illiteracy is still rampant among the black kat hordes, so they have once more taken to eating the pilfered pages rather than using them for arcane rituals` ([Kataclysmic Confrontation!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/100025)) and `Black kats are the darkest souls of the former Kat Tribe. They carry the heaviest curse of all and mindlessly seek to devour magical auras. This constant consuming of power makes them incredibly strong. They were likely attracted to the power radiating from the ancient grimoires here in the Archives` ([Kataclysmic Confrontation - Pembrooke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke#Dialogue)).

Among several instances of our tests in attempt to desipher this, potentially incomplete, language we came to a sugestion, which takes foundation in taoism, as several our topics regarding nature of energy and souls. Specifically, what is the symbols on the console and the Artifact were not mant to represent works, but rather chained together concepts, reminiscent of taoist trigrams?

The very fact that gremlin symbols are not enumerable for complete english alphabet, 15 symbols and a lack of one, are relatively similar both in count and rectangular shape to the aforementioned 8 trigrams, or 64 hexagrams, which correspond to more precise concepts. While this is a speculation, it fits with a few concepts which seemingly were derived of eastern philosophies explored ealier, specifically of those which had its influence onto alchemy in both western and eastern tradition.

#### Gremlin Schematics

We have extensively covered the facility where the schematics are located being complex 357.

We have analyzed the room the supposed schematics were located. Based on those we can came to a series of suggestion, each relating to its room in the facility:

- East room: gun block and its target, supposedly set up for testing.
- West room: Chemicals, minerals, and slime samples.
- Norse room: Ancient tomes with a potential to relate to Owlites.

How those objects relate to gremlins?

The east room had a canon, which is a common militaristic motif of gremlins on Cradle. The slime is known to be repurposed and changed by gremlins for the purpose of artificial subspecies of slimes used for operation of Clockworks' service facilities.

As for Owlites, as far as tomes' design goes and their usage of elementals for the operation of Clockworks, seem to be the primary and the deepest lead we can identify.

We could've also looked into other instances of gremlin schematics - and those relate to:

- `If this is true there will likely be a terminal of some kind close to one of Project R's components. Locate the terminal and recover the schematics for analysis. It should shed light on the exact nature of Project R` [Plant of Attack](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plan_of_Attack).
- `Gremlin construction sites often contain valuable schematics of gremlin structures and even weaponry. Once obtained by Spiral HQ, they provide rare insights into gremlin engineering. Gremlin schematics are typically stored in terminals somewhere on site. These terminals are locked down and heavily guarded` [Hazardous Heist](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hazardous_Heist).

But, compared to those, complex 357 lacks any terminals to extract those schematics. And given presence of paper clips, as well as books, we can suggest those being written on paper medium - an uncommon decision given gremlin cryptography is seemingly advanced enough even for Spiral Order, judging by the dialogue in the Aftermath: `It'll take forever to decipher gremlin cryptography` ([Operation Crimson Hammer - Aftermath - knight right of Feron]). Apart from being not digitalized, likely kept in secrecy, then, there is not much we can derive from those speculations. There are, as discussed, several aspects to those elements of the complex:

- Study of [rocket blocks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Rocket_Block.png), connection to mineral/crystal blocks and capacity to demolish those
- Excess presence of aforementioned crystals across complex grounds.
- Valestone being grinded to powder and ancient tomes.

As far as we have researched, we are unable to decipher the written form of the language. That is if it is an instance of a completed language. And, considering that most of this symbols would not be looked at, despite their consistency, it may be an unfinished set of characters or one we could not solve so far.

In this context, the language is not as important to the understanding contents of the schematics. And given our prior analysis of the complex, the context - the time Herex had infiltrated it prior to Shadowplay, - we make a guess, that the schematics, to an unknown degree, should describe foundational elements of Clockworks or even the Core, given Herex's context.

Then there are Herex's recon modules, with prior instances usually hinting his direct and physical presence in the past - such cases being Razwog's facility and Hidden Hideout with the first direct hint of Swarms' existence. Due to existence of those instances, we come to suggest, that Herex was present, at least, in the northern room of the complex, which can hint at our reasoning of those rooms containing the schematics.

If it is so, then, at least the room containing ancient tomes is the one connected the most with the contents of the schematics.

And now, if we recall the earlier chapters' discussions [regarding nature and symbolism of Nameless Realm]() and [Metaphysical Stack](), and how we have proposed Sleeper to be an energy-based entity same as Spirit Mother, it would be a proper question to ask, - _how gremlins have discovered Whitespace in the first place?_ And if they did not discover it, opened, or created, how this greater relation with Sleeper within the Core had begun?

In order to prevent ourselves from diving into the relation with the Sleeper, Core, Clockworks and the Swarm, we may relate to one element, mentioned by Parma in the Refuge: `Apologies for not appearing in person. I'm hidden away in a safe place. I knew I'd never make it here in time when I noticed your signal. Luckily I was able to pull some strings and find you an exit` ([Dreams and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Refuge)).

The fact Knight can get lost within the Whitespace of the Core, which itself can be controlled through unknown means, we can make a proposal.

Given further relation of gremlins to the Core, Consoles, and the Artifact, we propose, that the __schematics describe the specification of the Core__, which allow both to navigate and understand it as a megastructure revolving around physical principles, distinct from ones commonly observed in the material realm, albeit without inclusion of the Swarm, but, with consideration of Whitespace itself.

We are yet to understand, what is responsible for chaotic pathways within the Core, - weather it is effect of Swarm's presence or a natural environment, as one related to the Nameless Realm, in both instances retrieval of specification of the Core as a man-made location completely alien to the rest of Cradle seems to be a proper step of preparations before descending into one.

It can be argued that members of Crimson Order should be capable of understanding and traversing the Clockworks, yet, there is no evidence of such principles being directly applied nor observed. As far Spiral Order is aware, there is at least one instance of anomalous movement of large region across Clockworks, being Firestorm Citadel: `We thought things were getting pretty predictable, even at the depths you've been exploring. The Core was in sight. But now some kind of massive negative energy anomaly has surfaced above the Core, blocking access to it. Recon Knights have said that all they see near it is fire, endless fire. We don't know what it is just yet, but squads near that depth have already gone missing. This is bad news` ([Ending in Fire - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ending_in_Fire)).

#### Console: Part 3 - Artifact, Console, and a Hatch

It is suggested, that combination of the Artifact and console is capable of opening the Core. The terms of generator and the Artifact will be used interchangeably.

Ancient [Generator](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Artifact) can contain some amount of energy, as evident by Herex and Razwog dialogue, as Razwog was tasked to find a way to power the Generator: `Schemer Razwog: Work away from the others. The Order must never know we have the artifact. Find a way to power it. Bring it to me. Do not betray me. I will know` [Crossing the Chasm - The Journey to Haven - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crossing_the_Chasm/The_Journey_to_Haven) and `Too late again! I have already collected the power I need to use the Artifact and nothing you can do now will stop what I have set in motion` ([Shadowplay - Throne Room - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Throne_Room)). This energy, supposedly, allows t to power the console, as seen in the events of Shadowplay.

Originally, the generator is made known of in the Power Complex-[like](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Area-The_Ancient_Generator-Restoring_Power.png) facility, with wires [going up into the platform with the Artifact](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:TheArtifact-FirstSight.png). Both wires of the activated console and wires found all across Clockworks have the same animation of being powered, as a pulse of blue light travels across them. This design - of an idea of energy being transfered, - is similar to the pulse lines found in the holographic screen of an active console.

<!-- It is there both Cradle, its Moon, and Cradle's golden frame are depicted as essentials of what consoles operates with. Then, the intense light of an Artifact placed into the slot and connected to the console is similar to the light of the Core's shell plate seams, although lacking steam. Below the active console bolts of lightning are seen - that is another connection between role of Power Complexes and Clockworks, and general importance of energy. -->

There is a quote regarding Razwog's power complex: `Our scans have located an ancient generator below this camp. It should be sending power to the surface, but something seems to be diverting it. We need you to go investigate the ancient generator and divert power back to the surface` ([Rescue Camp - Greta](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greta_Dialogue/Rescue_Camp)). Given the ends of this operation, we interpret this quote as if Razwog's facility was the one to prevent generator from sending power. The very fact of Spiral Order identifyinf the generator as the source of power conflicts with the earlier Herex's quote: `Schemer Razwog: Work away from the others. The Order must never know we have the artifact. Find a way to power it. Bring it to me. Do not betray me. I will know` ([Crossing the Chasm - The Journey to Haven - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crossing_the_Chasm/The_Journey_to_Haven)). This can be partially resolved through an idea of the generator now being charged, and at the time of Herex's quote it was not.

Yet, it is unknown weather generator was originally found in Razwog's facility or was placed in order to be powered by the facility.

Moreover, it is stated that its power is being diverted, as rerouted. To where it is rerouted. The only lead here is the quote from Feron: `The name's Feron, Lieutenant of the Spiral Order. We had believed this entire complex was derelict until the elevator leading to it suddenly surged to life. Upon investigating the whole place soon went up in a blaze!` ([Crossing the Chasm - The Journey to Haven - Feron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crossing_the_Chasm/The_Journey_to_Haven)). It suggests, that the facility was observed to be inactive, and as it is reached through a previously inactive elevator in the Resque Camp, we suggest that it is power of the generator which reactivated this part of Clockworks.

Then it is the other matter is of the fact that Herex warned off Razwog: `The Order must never know we have the artifact` ([Crossing the Chasm - The Journey to Haven - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crossing_the_Chasm/The_Journey_to_Haven)). This suggests, that:

- __Artifact was not intended by the second highest gremlin authority - Crimson Order - to be found nor recovered__.

    The Artifact was located below the camp and was detectable from the surface. The fact that power was seemingly diverted of it could mean that it was used for a different purpose, we are unaware of that purpose.

- __Crimson Order is aware of Atrifact's function__. The seemingly un-powered state of the Artifact is then to be desired, as it was found by Herex as such.

This idea of Herex going against Crimson Order was explored in a few other instances:

- `The Iron Law is Broken! The Crimson Order is False! The Nine are blind, they cannot see the Truth that lies below. The Nine are deaf, they cannot hear the Resonance that beats within this world. Herex no longer serves as one of the Nine. Only Herex sees and hears the Truth. Only Herex will prevail. Follow Herex and you will be spared` ([Spark and Roar - Hidden Hideout - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hidden_Hideout)).
- `Infiltrate the Complex. Take all schematics. The Nine are quite but we will silence them. The Knights persue but we will halt them. Only Herex comprehends the Truth. Only Herex will descend. There can be no other` ([Crimson Chaos - Complex 357 - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Complex_357))

From this, we can conclude, that the __intention to open the Core is one prohibited by Crimson Order__.

##### Chronology of The Core Openning: Part 1

Alpha Squad was sent into the Clockworks right after the crash landing, and most of te missions did follow their path, where they left behind Recon Modules. In the Core their last recon module is found: `We are at the end of the line. ...  And then we could go no further. As I record this, the darkness is nearly upon us, consuming the world we see, the light. But then the Core, it began to open, filling the place with such a light, such an intense, blinding light. Euclid has made the call; faced with the darkness, we'll enter the core, enter the light` ([Recon Module: Entrance to the Core - Parma](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Recon_Module)). _It is the first time throughout rank missions Core was reported to open_.

_The second time_ core was reported to open was during [A Call to Arms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Call_to_Arms): `This is Vaelyn at the Core Terminal. Team wiped out. Darkness everywhere. Send help. It is opening` ([A Call to Arms - Vaelyn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Call_to_Arms#Dialogue)).

As we have no first-hand experiences of Alpha Suad desecnding into the Core, we will start our investigation from a more recent series of events, initialed by Shadowplay and followed by Vaelyn contacting regarding the Core in [A Call To Arms]().

The restoration of the Citadel by Nature Sprites was halted seemingly due to activation of the console: `Though the nature sprites have been steadily making progress in fighting the flames, something or someone has recently caused a violent resurgence in its destructive power. Spiral HQ requests that you gather together a crack squad of knights and return to the collapsing ruins of Firestorm Citadel in order to discover the source of the disturbance.` ([Shadowplay](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay)). Yet, _it is activated only by the time knight reaches the throne room_, as Herex places the Artifact within the console.

Then, there is a call from Vaelyn and only after which the events of Dream and Nightmares unfold, wherein Vaelyn reinstates, that the Core is opening in A Call To Arms. The issue we observe here is of interpretation and timeline before Shadowplay.

In [The Flickering Flame](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Flickering_Flame) the description states: `After your victory in Firestorm Citadel, the nature sprites of the great Spirit Mother finally began to make headway in battling the cursed flames engulfing the charred remains of Almire. A recent flare-up has impeded that progress, hinting at some lingering malevolent force that continues to fuel the fires. Contact Intel Agent Kora for details`. And then further Kora reinstates: `We were in the middle of receiving a report from Lieutenant Vaelyn's team at the Core Terminal when our signal was disrupted. It took some time, but I've managed to pinpoint the source of the disruption. It's coming from that strange device you discovered near Vanaduke's throne room in Firestorm Citadel. It seems like someone has activated it. ... [Activated it? How?] ... We don't know for sure but it has to be related to the Artifact. The energy signatures are identical. If the Artifact is involved that means...` ([The Flickering Flame - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Flickering_Flame)).

This can be interpreted in 2 ways: either the core opens particularly slowly, or it is a way to hammer in the point of Core opening in a non-diegetic form of suspence.

While the latter explanation supersedes any internal world logic, the prior does not, and, moreover, has to be explored in great detail. By that we mean a possibility of knight first reaching the surface, and only then receiving an emergency call from Vaelyn, if we consider ascent to the surface after Shadowplay as canon. On the other hand, we are not aware, weather effects of Artifact within the console differ from the state preceeding events of Shadowplay - that is what is the source of disruption, which had already had significant effects on the state of Citadel.

It here also unknown, what were the contents of the previous report, which was not recieved: `We were in the middle of receiving a report from Lieutenant Vaelyn's team at the Core Terminal when our signal was disrupted. It took some time, but I've managed to pinpoint the source of the disruption` ([The Flickering Flame - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Flickering_Flame)). But, as it is was stated, that Spiral HQ was in the middle of receiving a report, which can be interpreted as a comlink was already established and it was a regular report, or, it was blocked prior to being received.

Then, in both cases, the disruption was sudden. It is here we are unaware of how much time has passed since Lord Vanaduke was vanquished, as up to that point most of the cavern within which Firestorm Citadel is located, was extinguished.

We can gather that right after Vanaduke was defeated, Vaelyn started her expedition: `I understand that Lieutenant Vaelyn has already led a team to the Core terminal and is establishing a base of operations for research` ([Honor and Duty - Feron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Honor_and_Duty)), and by the next mission a contact with the Core Terminal was established: `We've already established our research base and are collecting a tremendous amount of data that we would have never had without your efforts.` ([The Search Continues - Vaelyn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Search_Continues)). It is then assumed that the knight had to reach the Core Terminal at least once, evident by already established dialogue with Vaelyn and her team in [The Path is Sealed](), as well as the team reaching the Core during a few missions after [The king of Ashes]():

- `I understand that Lieutenant Vaelyn has already led a team to the Core terminal and is establishing a base of operations for research` ([Honor and Duty - Feron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Honor_and_Duty)).
- `We've already established our research base and are collecting a tremendous amount of data that we would have never had without your efforts` ([The Search Continues - Vaelyn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Search_Continues)).

Based of Herex's activity, we can gather that he and his supposed "inner fold" (`All traces of Compound 42 should be eliminated, along with the facility and any engineers not part of the inner fold. Remind the scorchers who find these orders uncomfortable that those who disobey shall soon hear my whisper in their ears` - [Compound 42 - Containment - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42/Containment)) moved into the Citadel once it became safe to traverse. We considered inner group mainly due to presence of gremlins in the Throne Room of Shadowplay with Herex. Here, real-time insertion of the Artifact into the console could be a hyperbolic gesture to emphasize the stakes at certain moment. Yet, we propose, this would not disregard the fact that the Core was opening and before it energy signature of the Artifact was detected. We could have unlinked this activity within the console to Core opening, but, due to how narrative is posed, it is the most likely connection.

With this we have a following questions to examine:

- Was the Core openning before events of Shadowplay?
- Is the time of detected by Spiral HQ energy signature one of the Artifact changing its state to charged or is it of the Console's activation with the charged Artifact which resonates across Clockworks?

##### Chronology of The Core Openning: Part 2

There is an instance of the first time Core opening, which was witnessed by the Alpha Squad. This is the point of inconsistency introduced in the previous section:

- `First, we've located an energy signature similar to the one emanating from that Artifact you found in the Clockworks. We're homing in on that energy signature now. Finding the source might help us understand what that gremlin schemer Razwog planned on doing with the Artifact or what the device is actually capable of` ([A New Threat - Lobby - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_New_Threat/Lobby)).

  Dialogue happens while the Artifact is in the Lab. This establishes, based on later events, that Royal Jelly Palace was this source but by the time the knight arrives, the console is destroyed and the Artifact is absent.

- `Hmm, most of our sensor equipment seems to have been damaged. It might take some time to get things working to the point where I can track down the Artifact` ([A New Threat - The Lab - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_New_Threat/The_Lab)). Dialogue happens after the Artifact was stollen.
- `I've been able to track down the source of that energy signature. Here is the bad news: the energy source has been pinpointed to a highly dangerous area of the Clockworks that Recon Knights have dubbed the 'Royal Jelly Palace.' ... The energy signature is coming from somewhere in the Royal Jelly Palace and we need you to investigate. Royal Jellies are very territorial so you might have to get past its lair in order to reach your objective` ([Another Trace - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Another_Trace))

  Dialogue happens some time prior to descend to the Royal Jelly Palace.

The series of quotes, we suggest, refer to the _single instance of the signal_, captured prior and up to the events of [A New Threat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_New_Threat). We are aware, that Spiral HQ had no knowledge of consoles, but only the identification of the signal as related to the Artifact.

The first time Artifact was identified was when it was charging adn stored in Razwog's facility. The energy signal suggests it already being charged: `Our scans have located an ancient generator below this camp. It should be sending power to the surface, but something seems to be diverting it. We need you to go investigate the ancient generator and divert power back to the surface` ([Rescue Camp - Greta](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greta_Dialogue/Rescue_Camp)). The location of the energy signature from A New Threat is then identified to come from Royal Jelly Palace, but based on the experiece of the second console's activaton: `It took some time, but I've managed to pinpoint the source of the disruption. its coming from that strange device you discovered near Vanaduke's throne room in Firestorm Citadel. It seems like someone has activated it ... We don't know for sure but it has to be related to the Artifact. The energy signatures are identical. If the Artifact is involved that means...` ([The Flickering Flame - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Flickering_Flame)), it seemingly would require someone to activate the console in Royal Jelly Palace as well. Given the state of the console there, we are leaning to the idea of Herex activating it.

As the Artifact was in possession of Spiral Order from Razwog's facility to A New Threat, this would raise a further question:

__Is introduction of the Artifact to the console identical to console being activated__?

##### Chronology of The Core Openning: Part 3

With this question at hand, we can start to build from it. We can answer of this question in 2 opposite ways:

- Introduction Artifact is identical to console's activation.
- Activation of the console is not identical to Artifact being placed within.

Here, we would change our focus back to the Artifact itself, as an essential device for Herex's plans.

The Artifact is capable of being charged, and it is a requirement for Herex to introduce it to the console to Shadowplay: `Too late again! I have already collected the power I need to use the Artifact and nothing you can do now will stop what I have set in motion. ... Go. I will allow you to have one last moment before I destroy your meddling kind. However, should you choose to turn down my generous offer then you are welcome to come and face me in the Core where I will hasten your demise` ([Shadowplay - Throne Room - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Throne_Room)).

There is an important elements to his quote: `Too late again! I have already collected the power I need to use the Artifact` ([Shadowplay - Throne Room - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Throne_Room)). The fact that the knight is late not for the first time, identified by `again`, __suggests a prior case under similar circumstances__. As far as we are aware, there is only one similar instance of events like this - a signal and a console in the Ryal Jelly Palace. Therein, the console was destroyed, a peculiarity, which fits with the idea of Artifact remaining within the console. But, it would imply, that:

- Either the console had to be activated before A New Threat - allowing for Artifact to be placed in. The Artifact had to be placed after its retrieval in A New threat by Herex and carried to the Royal Jelly Palace.
- The Artifact had to be placed into the console before it would be removed from there, and recharged at Razwog's facility. But, it would conflict with the idea of that console being destroyed.

With this, we have our next question based on the following quotes:

- `Hmm, most of our sensor equipment seems to have been damaged. It might take some time to get things working to the point where I can track down the Artifact` ([A New Threat - The Lab - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_New_Threat/The_Lab)).
- `I've been able to track down the source of that energy signature. Here is the bad news: the energy source has been pinpointed to a highly dangerous area of the Clockworks that Recon Knights have dubbed the 'Royal Jelly Palace.' ... The energy signature is coming from somewhere in the Royal Jelly Palace and we need you to investigate. Royal Jellies are very territorial so you might have to get past its lair in order to reach your objective` ([Another Trace - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Another_Trace)).

It may be interpreted in a different way - of the Artifact being tracked rather than the original signal. If we assume a _continious tracking_ of the Artifact, it had resulted in identification of the Royal Jelly Palace as the point of interest. The other way was suggested earlier - of the signature of Royal Jelly Palace being one to be discoverred at A New Threat.

With those 2 interpretation we are left with 2 potential signals - of the original signal at A New Threat, and one belonging to the Artifact from tracking it by Kora.

To resolve this issue, we will reference Herex's earlier note on knight being late. Under this logic, if we consider Artifact being tracked while it was with Herex, his statement of being late would be explained by his awareness of knights persuing him to the Royal Jelly Palace, _wherein he would place the Artifact into the console before arrival of the knight_.

##### Chronology of The Core Openning: Part 4

The potential case of console's activation being decoupled from Artifact's introduction seems to us as a more solid foundation to work from based on currently derived information.

Now, we need to analyze the context of Vaelyn's message: `A frantic emergency comlink message broadcast across all channels` ([A Call to Arms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Call_to_Arms)): `This is Vaelyn at the Core Terminal. Team wiped out. Darkness everywhere. Send help. It is opening` ([A Call to Arms - Vaelyn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Call_to_Arms)).

Given earlier context of [The Flickering Flame](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Flickering_Flame): `We were in the middle of receiving a report from Lieutenant Vaelyn's team at the Core Terminal when our signal was disrupted. It took some time, but I've managed to pinpoint the source of the disruption. It's coming from that strange device you discovered near Vanaduke's throne room in Firestorm Citadel. It seems like someone has activated it`, we are met with the idea of the disruption either ending once the Artifact was placed into the console, or remaining as-is, forcing an `emergency comlink message broadcast across all channels`. We would suggest, that on the on-site Core team's side it would be a case of abrupt end of communication, followed by opening of the Core once the Artifact was placed, and given curcumstances of the ongoing disruption, a message would be sent as an emergency broadcast. Since there was no experience of jamming during extraction of the Artifact from Razwog's facility, we would suggest that _this property is restricted to consoles_.

Followed description of [Dreams and Nightmares](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares): `Respond to the distress signal from the Core Terminal. We have no intel on what to expect. This is a dangerous mission. Prepare for anything` would suggest then, that the knight had not descened to the Core Terminal after Shadowplay's end, _preserving diegesis of separate missions_.

With this approach in mind, we can now relate back to the first opening of the Core with Alpha Squad at the Core terminal.

Under the proposed logic, placement of the Artifact into the console starts the process of Core opening - which is seen twice and corresponding to both instances involving Herex. With this, it becomes evident, that __by the time Herex has activated the Royal Jelly Palace console, Alpha Squad had reached the Core terminal__.

Based on Alpha Sqaud recon modules, we can gather, that the rank mission progression from Skylark crew crash landing up to mission of [Sovereign Slime]() was enough for Alpha Squad to reach the Core:

- `As Spiral HQ is not yet fully operational and most systems are offline, these personal recordings will have to suffice as a record of our expedition until HQ can establish an Uplink system with squads in the field` ([Recon Module: Gloaming Wildwoods - Euclid](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Recon_Module)).

  It relates to a time prior to Knights even reaching Haven: `We discovered a town known as 'Haven' and have set up a base of operations there. The locals have provided us with food, shelter and power. its not Isora, but its home for now. I've pinpointed your location. Unfortunately you'll need to cross a massive chasm in order to reach Haven. Perhaps now that your camp has power there is an elevator somewhere leading into the Clockworks. You may just be able to reach us that way` ([First Contact - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/First_Contact)).

- `We narrowly evaded a gremlin trap today. Ambushed on a platform above a pit of molten slag, we had to hold our ground against a horde of the snarling beasts as we dodged incoming rocket fire from above. Fun stuff. Grantz took the full blast of a rocket twice, reacting only with a stagger as if he had discovered a stone in his boot. Sometimes I think that beneath his iron suit is a body of equally heavy iron. It wouldn't surprise me. Parma has been hard on herself, saying that she should have scouted the trap. But how can you scout a world that is ever in flux? How can you be sure that the path ahead is still safe if you can never be sure its still even there?` ([Recon Module: Ironclaw Munitions Factory - Rulen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Recon_Module)).
- `Within the Clockworks we can afford little sleep. Hostiles are around every corner and many of the environments are unsuitable for camp. But when sleep comes, I find myself dreaming more than I ever have before. In my dreams I see Cradle, slowly turning and drifting through the stars. I see the patches of its varying terrain unfold and stretch across the stars like an enormous quilt. It is an oddly comforting dream, to see a world unravel itself... But then I wake, and the chaos of the Clockworks engulfs me once more; the groans of its ever-turning cogs and howls of the terrible beasts that call it home echoing everywhere. I hope to return one day to the surface, to a sun, to a place where peace is more than a fleeting dream` ([Recon Module: The Gauntlet - Euclid](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Recon_Module)).

Considering that during the events of Shadowplay Artifact had remained in the console, we suggest that it was not intended to be taken out. It seems conclusive, that the moment console was properly activated with introduction of the Artifact, identical to the first captured energy signal at Royal Jelly Palace's console, it became the cause for Core's hatch to open temporarily the exact moment Alpha Squad had reached the Core Terminal after passing through the Firestorm Citadel. As Parma had stated to be followed by the Swarm prior to Core opening, we can further suggest, that the process of opening the Core attracts the Swarm: `We are at the end of the line. Pursued by some kind of terrible darkness we are forced into the unknown. As we neared the Core- I don't know how to describe this really... the shadows came alive and began to attack us. Rulen became enveloped in it and by the time Grantz freed him his body was badly burned. He said it felt like both fire and ice. And then we could go no further. As I record this, the darkness is nearly upon us, consuming the world we see, the light. But then the Core, it began to open, filling the place with such a light, such an intense, blinding light. Euclid has made the call; faced with the darkness, we'll enter the core, enter the light` ([Recon Module: Entrance to the Core - Parma](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Recon_Module)).

Introduction of the Artifact to the Console, paired with Herex's dialogue: `I have already collected the power I need to use the Artifact and nothing you can do now will stop what I have set in motion` ([Shadowplay - Throne Room - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Throne_Room)) suggests, that it is the reason for Core's hatch opening, but, in order to work - to open the Core, - each time Artifact had to be recharged, it was already charged during the events of [The Ancient Generator](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Ancient_Generator) by Razwog.

Lastly, it is due to desctiption of [The Flickering Flame](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Flickering_Flame): `A recent flare-up has impeded that progress, hinting at some lingering malevolent force that continues to fuel the fires. Contact Intel Agent Kora for details`, we have [earlier]() proposed, that proper activation had to result in negation of Nature Sprites' activity, while Darkfire Vanaduke and generl state of the Citadel was explained though Undercorp being involved with the plot and responsible for the current status quo of Cradle.

#### Core Terminal and Unknown Passage

As we are approaching the Core, the distinct designs become more important. Throughout terminals' analysis we will identify common motifs present only across a strict set of the depths. Those will include regular _Clockwork Terminals_, the _Core Terminal_, and the __Unknown Passage__.

We will focus primarily on architecture and the design patterns which would allow to group those. As much of those locations are related to the Swarm, we consider its potential influence, as mentioned in [relation to nature of the schematics](), but so far we will start from the basic premise of common design elements as they are presented, weather or not those were a result of a third party's actions.

Primary element of all Clockwork Tunnels, Terminals, the Arcade and the Unknown Passage is the usage of regular Clockworks' elements with no regional status effects. Given presence of many other regions and areas with defined status effects, regular tunnels are only also encountered across instances of Haunted Passage, the undead levels.

Another, subtle element present across both the Core Terminal and the Unknown Passage is the chaotic mechanical design.

On the main platform of the Core Terminal its most distinctive element is found, apart from the Core itself in the background - a peculiar amount of monitors is irregularly stacked across the platform and walls. Those monitors are shown to depict only a single image on their screens, being a blue lock, or, in case of [Dreams and Nightmares](), an eye of Swarm-infested depths.

Based on the designs of Grand Arsenal, briefing room at Aftermath specifically, we can conclude that the _monitors are gremlin technology_. Those possess retrofuturistic design with its screen's image distinct scan lines and general box-like shape reminiscent of analog television with application of cathode-ray tube. Evident by presence of color, this technology can be mapped at least onto the standards from real-world second half of 20s century.

In case of the Unknown Passage, despite it being infested by the Swarm, a design element can be seen through depth's layout - an inexplicable random placement of the 5-tile width and 3-tile width catwalks, with a few looping sections, separated by the switch gates and irregularly placed 1-tile platforms which Swarm turrets emerge from.

The Unknown Passage also has unexplained presence of walls and roof elements - this characteristic of walls is more pronounced at the Core Terminal. There, the entire main platform has a cone-like shape, ending at the precipice of the ground elevator to a lower platform. This design of an extended, rounded platform with a ground elevator leading to a lower walkway directly below an outlook point is very similar to the walkways in the Haven Arcade after the descend to the elevation of the gates proper at the foundation of Arcade Pillars from Arcade's cavern. But, in case of the Core Terminal, the lower walkway, which is a few tiles away from the Core hatch itself, is broken off, with the Core hatch itself, of course, being sealed.

The rest of the Core Terminal platform, its sides are protected by walls, with a small wall located at platform's center, where several monitors are placed against it. While walls can be explained by general safety measures, the chaotic element both of the Unknown Passage and Core Terminal's monitors seems as one requiring an analysis.

While Unknown Passage's layout can be written off as the result of Swarm intersecting Clockworks' operation, the monitors had to be explicitly placed by somebody in such manner. We propose, that such placement is intentional and designed to introduce an 'organic' aspect of Clockworks. This aspect is also suggested by Vaelyn:

- `I am confident that aside from a potential energy source, the Core is a kind of nerve center for everything you see within the Clockworks. You can feel it in what little air is down here; a wild, ominous sense that this is no mere machine` ([Vaelyn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vaelyn)).
- `Everything about the Core suggests there are no 'doors' into it. its not a structure built to enter from the outside. Rather, it seems just the opposite. ... I don't know, but it is certainly a terrifying picture she has painted. Something stirs within the heart of this world, something terrible. I've felt it since we first set foot on this world; invisible eyes watching our every move, shapes that form just out of view... something greater than gremlins calls this world home` ([The Search Continues - Vaelyn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Search_Continues)).

    The part where `invisible eyes watching our every move, shapes that form just out of view` is closely similar to the Swarm, as an entity with eye symbolism. The same motif was presented by Herex: `I am the thousand eyes that watch you in the darkness. I am the hissing blade that whispers your doom. Tear down every wall and cog in this accursed place and you will find only shadows` ([A New Threat - The Lab - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_New_Threat/The_Lab)).

- `The Core that we seek, there's something truly dreadful about it. I know that it may very well be what gets us home, but I can't shake this feeling that we've been thinking about it all wrong. ... I mean that the Core isn't a big battery that runs this world, but rather it and the whole of this world is a massive prison designed to keep something from ever leaving. Think about our geo-scans of Cradle just before the crash- they show it as being composed of hundreds of massive slabs of other worlds, almost like plates of armor. Then you have the Clockworks, the most unnatural thing I've ever seen. An entire world whose sole purpose seems to be stopping anyone from ever reaching its Core` ([Becoming a Champion - Feron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Becoming_a_Champion)).
- `This is a world designed to confuse its travelers. It wants to trap and destroy them. I'm starting to think its like a cat, toying with its prey before delivering the final blow` ([Recon Module: Ironclaw Munitions Factory - Rulen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Recon_Module)).

From here, we can finally begin to analyze the Swarm. First we have to return to the monitors.

In the state, when the Core is sealed, imagery of locks is blue with a 2-color blue pattern similar to gate icons behind the static. During the event of [The Path is Revealed](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/The_Path_is_Revealed), the static overtakes the background, rendering it black. From here on out, we will consider appearances of the Swarm as canon. This alone demonstrates, that Swarm is capable of interacting with gremlin, and potentially any, technology, making itself present and aware of through this medium, such as HUD of knights.

#### Causality of Shadow Lairs

As far as we have analyzed peculiar cases of cause and effect within the timeline - specifically, the logic and general mechanics behind Artifact consoles' activations and energy surging, we came to an idea of the process itself of consoles' activation being relatively more prolonged, than we have initially assumed.

##### Artifact Console Recap

Through this logic we came to an idea of the Artifact being placed into the console does not mean beginning of energy surge from console's location, but rather the energy surged are part of console's preparation. With this, we have managed to explain the events of Shadowplay, as the Artifact was placed once the knight have arrived, while energy surged were identified earlier.

The same logic was applied at the console of Royal Jelly Palace, as its activation had to precede the events of [Ancient Generator](), as only one signal was received by Spiral Order of an energy surge, and triangulated (`First, we've located an energy signature similar to the one emanating from that Artifact you found in the Clockworks. We're homing in on that energy signature now` - [A New Threat - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_New_Threat/Lobby)) by the time existence of Royal Jelly Palace was revealed (`I've been able to track down the source of that energy signature` - [Another Trace - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Another_Trace)). The establishment of proper location of the signal during the events of [A New Threat]() was sabotaged by attack on the Lab. Due to this we have concluded, that the signal had to be sent before knights had to acquire the Artifact, meaning, that it was charging in Razwog's facility _after its removal from the console_, which would eventually be found to be destroyed in the Throne Room of Royal Jelly Palace.

There, we have also proposed, that it is in that moment in time Alpha Squad had reached the Core, implying that the events of the first rank mission had to happen near the end of Alpha Squad's descent, or, the time spent in the Rescue Camp had to be far longed to accommodate for the descend, retrieval of the Artifact from the Palace and its placement into a facility below Rescue Camp.

Generally, as stated in the beginning of [shadow lairs section](#shadow-lairs), all Shadow Lairs follow seemingly a different continuity - as if they were located in a different timeline or chronology, separate from the rank missions.

##### Shadow Firestorm Citadel Recap

In the first analysis of Shadow Lairs - of Shadow Firestorm Citadel, - we proposed its approximate position within a timeline as following an activation of the console in the Throne Room, causing the entire cavern to be set aflame. Then, the proposed involvement of Undercorp as the only major actor within entire narrative, capable to manipulate curse to such extent, linking it both to cursing the Citadel and summoning Black Kats across Clockworks.

Through curse, the Citadel was transformed, with a few its portions resembling its crumbling state.

As for Lord Vanaduke, as we had his still cursed finery, we suggested it being the evidence for his soul remains to linger both through phenomenon of [haunting]() and [specifics of his finery and mask's alchemy and design]().

Then there was the case of Carnavons and Dread Seals. Based on earlier analysis of Black Kats, and then curse in general, we came to an idea of Dread Seal specifically - of a magic seal of purple color, and a seal on Faust, - to be Underworld's creating, while only Avenger's alchemy tree and sealed sword had their curse inverted or suppressed (in latter case). Through this logic we proposed, that _the seal is used in this case of application to forcefully bind an already departed soul to a corporeal body_, causing it to remain. This principle was then extrapolated onto Darkfire Lord Vanaduke, as his armor was prime argument for the Undercorp's involvement - explaining armor's design as forged from shadow steel with a purpose of containing Lord Vanaduke's soul brought back into material realm [over changed metaphysics of Cradle]().

While those logical leaps resolve most of causal conflicts and contradictions, they present a level of interpretation, which either has no intention to be this complicated, oversight, or is intentional series of design choices, given our exploration of the timeline.

As we follow the idea of intentional designs such as these, we will attempt to justify existence of Shadow Lairs through this framework of a few prime actors within the timeline.

##### Shadow Gloaming Wildwoods Recap

Shadow Gloaming Wildwoods were the result of Undercorp reenacting events of titans' fall through the release of curse into the woods from the collapsed grim gates' portals, paired with potential of Spiral Order discovering staging area of corrupted tortodrones during [March of Tortodrones]().

##### Variants of Unknown Passage

But, both Shadow Royal Jelly Palace and the rest of Shadow Lairs happen seemingly in a near-identical period of time, given their presence as Shadow Lairs, as well as the announcement of "Shadows falling over Cradle". The only seemingly unconventional event to take place similar to event of Shadow Lairs is the anomalous event of Firestorm Citadel resurfacing over the Core. As it is characterized as such, we have to assume that some faction is responsible. Not Undercorp explicitly, but, given the idea of Iron Law being a measure to hold Core locked, - Crimson Order. While this explanation has plausibility, it does not explain the whole notion of shadow falling over Cradle, as well as their corresponding placement in the timeline.

Here we will _further attempt reasoning out of a different canon_, as an alternative interpretation to already visited events. We will place events of Shadow Lairs in concrete points of the timeline.

The entire depth of Shadow Lairs also contains the Unknown Passage, which was established as seemingly "more canon", than its iteration in [It Came From Below](), as the latter instance had no justified reason to contain Whitespace blocks while not leading into the Whitespace.

Here we will disclose an idea, which will be later explored in detail, but one we are rather confident - that the Unknown Passage lead into the breach within the Core, which Parma in the Refuge will mention: `` ([Dreams and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout]()).

Under this, we believe, that Sleeper is unable to control entrances to the Core, unless those are opened temporary by the Consoles. The only case of such was the Royal Jelly Palace and Shadowplay. And, as the only case of descending into the Core by the knight was during Dreams and Nightmares, we assume, that the Unknown Passage in [The Descend into Darkness]() of [It Came From Below]() had to be either located far above the near-Core depths, so that entrance to the Core was not reachable, - which would contradict presence of Whitespace structures, or the Swarm had to ascend to the lower depths, while the Core was sealed for the Gates operate as expected.

Judging by the fact Swarm is present in the Hidden Hideout - a Crimson Order facility at a lower depth, seem to imply that _Swarm can under certain conditions leave Shadow Lairs._

While at least one expedition to the Core Terminal after the King of Ashes is seemingly expected to happen, given presence of Vaelyn's on-site core team, which was a plot point, then knight had to uncover depth 23 Clockwork Terminal's northern location of a few knights around the Shadow Lairs' elevators. It is the Shadow Key then, which would forbid further descend into the lairs. The item is out of place, both due to being a Swarm-related item, and a mechanic, never seen before. Of course, we assume there are lore reasons for the key to exist.

While we do not have an explanation for Swarm's initial ascent in the events of It Came From Below, we propose one for Shadow Lairs.

We have positioned events of Shadow Firestorm Citadel after Dreams and Nightmares. Then, there are other boss depths, located above depth 23.

What if those depths, given their themes, were also the result of Undercorp's doing - fortifying the other entrance to the Core?

##### Shadow Royal Jelly Palace

Involvement of Undercorp seems us fitting both for Shadow Gloaming Wildwoods and Shadow Royal Jelly Palace, wi the later being a re-enactment of Maulos's invasion of Amu-Sol. His being a everfrost-imbued trojan with a proactive goal seem to parallel Ice Queens arrival to the Palace. We suggest, that as toxoils, oilers, and blast cubes were artificially created by gremlins, so was Ice Cubes and Ice Queen, - serving in the same manner as oiler, but bor cooling chamber - as both the location and frost-themed enemies are connected to supernatural frost of everfrost. Given earlier analysis of other regions of Clockworks, this seems plausible, as a if even slime royalty was involved into the experiments.

##### Shadow Ironclaw Munitions Factory

Lastly, there is Shadow Ironclaw Munitions Factory. The original factory, while in possession of Ironclaw clan of gremlins was ordered to mass-produce Roarmulus Twins, so it is particularly close to warmaster Seerus. By the time Spiral Order invades Grand Arsenal during operation Crimson Hammer, it is given as if those events take place after [Built to Destroy](), a Spiral Order is already aware of Project R.

As warmaster Seerus already establishes a state Crimson Order is in, we believe, as an explanation for specifically Red Roarmulus Twins would be one attributed to the fact Firestorm Citadel before Shadowplay was un-traversable given its risks, despite housing a console.

Essentially, the turn to near-unnatural Vog-inspired hazardous design of Red Roarmulus Twins, we believe, is the idea of replicating state of Firestorm Citadel as most potent defense and offense. As Grand Arsenal was already heavily fire-themes, especially the battlepod with fire lasers, as ones of Red Roarmulus Twins, further development of fiery theme seems fitting at least in the context of Seerus's affiliations with fire status effect.

The idea of Herex silencing the rest of Crimson Order would then further escalate the danger between Seerus and Herex, justified by Seerus's suspicions of Spiral Order being sent by Herex as "Iron Assassins". Due to this, we lean into the notion of Red Roarmulus Twins being made after Seerus's escape from the Grand Arsenal, albeit with no distinctly identified intent.

##### Acknowledgement of Encounters with the Swarm

Another note on the canon of Shadow Lairs is the response to threat of the Swarm within both rank missions and outside of them.

There is no reaction on the result of an expedition into those. Events of [It Came From Below](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/It_Came_From_Below/Into_the_Maw) demonstrate the threat of the Swarm without a distinct follow-up in the form of conversations with Spiral HQ. But, it shows a precedent of Swarm being presented as a main threat.

Given current knowledge of Swarm based on the contents of Shadow Lairs, as in the boss depths of Shadow Lairs, a depth preceding Unknown Passage is, in the very end, influenced by the Swarm - we can create an approximate suggestion of an elevator rerouting into the Shadow Lair, combined with expansive influence of the Swarm, given the follow-up mission of [Flickering Flame](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Flickering_Flame), implying that events, which had to propel post-Vanaduke arc revolving around the Swarm, had to stem from the initial activation of the Console, catching attention of Spiral HQ: `We were in the middle of receiving a report from Lieutenant Vaelyn's team at the Core Terminal when our signal was disrupted. It took some time, but I've managed to pinpoint the source of the disruption. It's coming from that strange device you discovered near Vanaduke's throne room in Firestorm Citadel. It seems like someone has activated it. We don't know for sure but it has to be related to the Artifact. The energy signatures are identical` ([The Flickering Flame - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Flickering_Flame)).

Apart from this, the events of this mission were not acknowledge in any form apart from `As if all these strange occurrences weren't bad enough, I have some shocking news for you` ([The Flickering Flame - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Flickering_Flame)).

Here we can compare depths of Shroud of Apocrea to the Shadow Lairs - a notable distinction is to be made here - Apocrean depths have a [background](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Grasping_Plateau), which follows gate icon design pattern. Due to this, as well due to roster of Void enemies within the Unknown Passage, we can assume, that Swarm does modify what is intended to be seen on the gates, removing any distinction between nature of artificial, mechanical, and organic entities. With this assumption, the presence of Unknown Passage in the events of It Came From Below seems as if the Swarm itself was ascending from the Shadow Lairs. The influence it exceeds on surrounding depths is consistent across all encounters.

Based on the fact that slime generators were the reason behind knights unable to reach farther than depth 23, means that the terminal remained for a time the deepest point of exploration. So, this would mean that Shadow Lairs would not be accessible from any other location. Moreover, most of the locations preserve their structure, which, apart from budget reasons, would mean that those are the same locations, now placed into Shadow Lairs.

Due to this we can attempt to fit events of Shadow Lairs right before the events of Shadowplay or after Dreams and Nightmares.

- `The Gloaming Wildwoods has been infected with a poisonous miasma and the Snarbolax is said to have gone rabid!`

  As discussed earlier, Snarbolax had to be defeated, unless it is not one of its kind. This can be potentially resolved through the presence of [Snarblepup](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Snarblepup). Based on earlier instances of battle sprites reaving on Cradle's past, this could be an explanation for Rabid Snarbolax's existence.

- `The Royal Jelly Palace has frozen over and its king usurped by the true heir to the slimy throne, the frigid Ice Queen!`

  Could mean that Ice Queen did arrive after the initial defeat of the Jelly King during [Sovereign Slime](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Sovereign_Slime).

  And, if the Queen supposedly herself usurped the throne, _this would not fit into the current timeline_.

- `The Ironclaw Munitions Factory has begun creating in fiery weapons and improved upon its ultimate weapon in the form of the Red Roarmulus Twins!`

  The factory did contain multiple instances of Project R models, with 2 pods absent in the hangar. The first time Roarmulus Twins are mention is as follows: `Project R appears to be in fact two massive weapons known as the 'Roarmulus Twins.' Designed by one of the Crimson Order itself, the Roarmulus Twins are some kind of construct cannon that the gremlins intend on moving up the Clockworks into the Haven Arcade!` ([Target Acquired - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Target_Acquired)). Due to this, we can gather that at least within the logic of moving those into Haven, multiple of their instances would be present.

  Possibility of a scenario wherein gremlins would have to improve upon the existing model, we suggest, exists only under the condition of the previous iteration - the regular Roarmulus Twins, - were defeated. So, _this would fit to the existing timeline of events_.

- `A powerful curse has overtaken the Firestorm Citadel, transforming its hordes and lead by the mighty Darkfire Lord Vanaduke!`

  With all of context in mind, for the cohesiveness of the narrative, we propose a potential 2 scenarios of fitting Shadow Firestorm Citadel and Darkfire Lord Vanaduke into the timeline:

  - Earlier we have mentioned, that a curse had to be applied externally, which resulted in transformation of the Citadel. Yet, it is stated, that Lord Vanaduke was not defeated, but transformed, suggesting that this Lair had to be traversed prior to the Events of [The King of Ashes](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_King_of_Ashes).

    This scenario is possible if the canon version of the citadel which was traversed is the Shadow one. And, as this was debunked, we can suggest that the unseen during the events of Shadowplay floors were afflicted by curse, in order for Darkfire Lord Vanaduke being the one to be defeated. And yet, his depth - the Throne Room - remains the same.

  - Shadow Firestorm citadel is the one Knights had to traverse after the events of Dreams and Nightmares.

    How it would be possible, as it is during Shadowplay we discover the overgrown state of the Citadel? Here we would consider the connection to the activated console with the Artifact: `Though the nature sprites have been steadily making progress in fighting the flames, something or someone has recently caused a violent resurgence in its destructive power` ([Shadowplay](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay)), as the [Throne Room](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Throne_Room) remains in the same fiery environment, even with the remains of the supposed ceiling after Lord Vanaduke's initial fight during [The King of Ashes](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_King_of_Ashes). As the Artifact had remained in the console, we can only suggest, that this was the reason for the reanimation of the Citadel, powered by the Core, as in many other instances - __the curse persists through supply of Energy__.

    This would simultaneously explain presence of dark embers as a material in small quantity, and allow for the thematically fitting counterpart to be present. To explore this resolution, we have to look at the nature of the curse and parallels across the stories involving it.

    As tortodrones, reactivated by dark matter, as Margrel, summoned from the Underworld, Darkfire Lord Vanaduke has more distinct presence of purple cracks across his armor. Paired with the idea of curse being applied to the citadel, we can gather, that this has to __involve devilites, and Nefarious Imp at that, as ones to inflict this curse onto the Citadel__.

    Due to this, Nature Sprites would be still present, but, absence of the console would not. Same applied for the Ice Queen, as her version of the Royal Jelly Palace _also lacks the console_. The only way to resolve this is to suggest that it was removed by actions of currently unknown actor, without leaning to a game direction and design reasons.

What unified all of Shadow Lairs, not only Firestorm Citadel, is the sudden activity.

- In case of Wildwoods, it was a miasma, which we suggested to be an event, reemerging from the past, when this cursed mist was weaponized through destruction of Grim Gates by devilites of Undercorp and subsequent release of curse into the woods, eventually resulting in creation of Snarbolax.
- Ice Queen had appeared from seemingly nowhere, bringing frost with her as Maulos some time ago. Everfrost as a vector of devilites' activity is a strong link here.
- Red Roarmulus Twins, taken all of the context, have resemblance not to volcanic sets, but corrupted by Vog, with characteristic hazardous design. Yet, this theme of fire is reminiscent of Warmaster Seerus's Grand Arsenal. Given him being a member of Crimson Order and possessing shadow-damaging technology, he can be tied to devilites.
- Darkfire Lord Vanaduke transformed through application of the second curse, involving devilites as the most prominent faction.

While we could not answer so far distinctly on the canon placement of Ice Queen's and Darkfire Lord Vanaduke's in the timeline, __the notion itself, of past events repeating is a motif which should not be overlooked, and, given later events of the Swarm as a distinct alchemical entity, this seems thematically fitting__.

Across all of those cases, _it is Undercorp which seemingly makes itself known_, the main force behind those events, both in present day, and in the past.

#### Alchemical Symbolism of Shadow Lairs: Great Work and Rebis

We propose, that Shadow Lairs as a separate expedition, contain a thematic element to them, found through their symbolic themes relating to alchemy, but also the Void: `I DREAM... WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER. YOU ARE SAFE HERE, KNIGHT. WITHIN THIS DREAM, ITS MANY EYES CANNOT SEE YOU NOR CAN ITS MANY ARMS REACH YOU.` ([Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods)). We will suggest` an idea of this Void is one being related to the alchemical Void, until then we will mainly focus on the symbolism of Shadow Lairs' expeditions, as in regards to all things Swarm-related, any assumption can and likely will swing final conclusion into an area of speculation. So, due to this, we are not about to make distinct claims, but rather point out the symbolic elements.

The notion of a descend into the Shadow Lairs, through the Unknown Passage, into the Sanctuary, and acquisition of a rare material, unique to the lair is, we believe, is an alchemical metaphor for the process of creation of the Great Work, and of a particular kind. By that we mean, as the phenomenon of alchemy as of pseudo-chemistry is rooted from a projection of inner consciousness onto a physical world, its elements also become symbolic. The theme is concealed in the alchemical process itself, and its final goal, here described from the english translation of Carl Jung's "Psychology and Alchemy":

<BookCitation source="Psychology and Alchemy - Carl Jung">
  {#snippet markup()}

  In the hero myth this state is known as being swallowed up in the belly of the whale or dragon. The heat there is usually so intense that the hero loses his hair, i.e., he is reborn bald as a babe. This heat is the ignis gehennalis, the hell into which Christ descended in order to conquer death as part of his opus. The philosopher makes the journey to hell as a ‚Äúredeemer.‚Äù The ‚Äúhidden fire‚Äù forms the inner antithesis to the cold wetness of the sea.

  The ‚Äútreasure hard to attain,‚Äù whose presence was suspected in the dark prima materia, is symbolized by the alchemists in various ways. Christopher of Paris, for instance, says that the chaos (as prima materia) is the work of all-wise nature. Our understanding ... , aided by the ‚Äúcelestial and glowing spirit,‚Äù must transform this natural work of art‚Äîchaos‚Äîinto the celestial nature of the quintessence, and into the life- giving (vegetabilis) essence of heaven. The precious substance is potentially contained in this chaos as a massa confusa of all the elements rolled into one, and man must diligently apply his mind to it so that ‚Äúour heaven‚Äù may come into reality (ad actum). Johannes Grasseus quotes the view that the prima materia is the lead (plumbum) of the philosophers, also called the ‚Äúlead of the air‚Äù (an allusion to the inner opposite). This lead contains the radiant white dove, called the ‚Äúsalt of the metals.‚Äù The dove is the ‚Äúchaste, wise, and rich Queen of Sheba, veiled in white, who was willing to give herself to none but King Solomon.‚Äù

  A similar idea is to be found in Michael Maier: The sun, by its many millions of revolutions, spins the gold into the earth. Little by little the sun has imprinted its image on the earth, and that image is the gold. The sun is the image of God, the heart is the sun‚Äôs image in man, just as gold is the sun‚Äôs image in the earth (also called Deus terrenus), and God is known in the gold. This golden image of God is the anima aurea, which, when breathed into common quicksilver, changes it into gold.

  Ripley is of the opinion that the fire must be extracted from the chaos and made visible. This fire is the Holy Ghost, who unites father and son. He is often represented as a winged old man, i.e., Mercurius in the form of the god of revelation, who is identical with Hermes Trismegistus and, together with the King and the King‚Äôs Son, forms the alchemical trinity. God wrought this fire in the bowels of the earth, just as he wrought the purging flames of hell, and in this fire God himself glows with divine love.

  The examples given in the last chapter show that there is a spirit hidden in the prima materia, just as there was in the Nile stone of Ostanes. This spirit was eventually interpreted as the Holy Ghost in accordance with the ancient tradition of the Nous swallowed up by the darkness while in the embrace of Physis‚Äîwith this difference, however, that it is not the supreme feminine principle, earth, who is the devourer, but Nous in the form of Mercurius or the tail-eating Uroboros. In other words, the devourer is a sort of material earth-spirit, an hermaphrodite possessing a masculine-spiritual and feminine-corporeal aspect. The original Gnostic myth has undergone a strange transformation: Nous and Physis are indistinguishably one in the prima materia and have become a natura abscondita.

  The psychological equivalent of this theme is the projection of a highly fascinating unconscious content which, like all such contents, exhibits a numinous‚Äî‚Äúdivine‚Äù or ‚Äúsacred‚Äù‚Äîquality. Alchemy set itself the task of acquiring this ‚Äútreasure hard to attain‚Äù and of producing it in visible form, as the physical gold or the panacea or the transforming tincture‚Äîin so far as the art still busied itself in the laboratory. But since the practical, chemical work was never quite free from the unconscious contents of the operator which found expression in it, it was at the same time a psychic activity which can best be compared with what we call active imagination. This method enables us to get a grasp of contents that also find expression in dream life. The process is in both cases an irrigation of the conscious mind by the unconscious, and it is related so closely to the world of alchemical ideas that we are probably justified in assuming that alchemy deals with the same, or very similar, processes as those involved in active imagination and in dreams, i.e., ultimately with the process of individuation.

  Earlier on, we left Arisleus and his companions, together with Beya and the dead Thabritius, in the triple glass house where they had been imprisoned by the Rex marinus. They suffer from the intense heat, like the three whom Nebuchadnezzar cast into the fiery furnace. King Nebuchadnezzar had a vision of a fourth, ‚Äúlike the Son of God,‚Äù as we are told in Daniel 3 : 25. This vision is not without bearing on alchemy, since there are numerous passages in the literature stating that the stone is trinus et unus. It consists of the four elements, with fire representing the spirit concealed in matter. This is the fourth, absent and yet present, who always appears in the fiery agony of the furnace and symbolizes the divine presence‚Äîsuccour and the completion of the work.

And, through the four stages of alchemical process:

<BookCitation source="Psychology and Alchemy - Carl Jung">
  {#snippet markup()}

  Four stages are distinguished, characterized by the original colours mentioned in Heraclitus: melanosis (blackening), leukosis (whitening), xanthosis (yellowing), and iosis (reddening). This division of the process into four was called the, the quartering of the philosophy. Later, about the fifteenth or sixteenth century, the colours were reduced to three, and the xanthosis, otherwise called the citrinitas, gradually fell into disuse or was but seldom mentioned. Instead, the viriditas sometimes appears after the melanosis or nigredo in exceptional cases, though it was never generally recognized. Whereas the original tetrameria corresponded exactly to the quaternity of elements, it was now frequently stressed that although there were four elements (earth, water, fire, and air) and four qualities (hot, cold, dry, and moist), there were only three colours: black, white, and red. Since the process never led to the desired goal and since the individual parts of it were never carried out in any standardized manner, the change in the classification of its stages cannot be due to extraneous reasons but has more to do with the symbolical significance of the quaternity and the trinity; in other words, it is due to inner psychological reasons.

  The nigredo or blackness is the initial state, either present from the beginning as a quality of the prima materia, the chaos or massa confusa, or else produced by the separation (solutio, separatio, divisio, putrefactio) of the elements. If the separated condition is assumed at the start, as sometimes happens, then a union of opposites is performed under the likeness of a union of male and female (called the coniugium, matrimonium, coniunctio, coitus), followed by the death of the product of the union (mortificatio, calcinatio, putrefactio) and a corresponding nigredo. From this the washing (ablutio, baptisma) either leads direct to the whitening (albedo), or else the soul (anima) released at the ‚Äúdeath‚Äù is reunited with the dead body and brings about its resurrection, or again the ‚Äúmany colours‚Äù (omnes colores), or ‚Äúpeacock‚Äôs tail‚Äù (cauda pavonis), lead to the one white colour that contains all colours. At this point the first main goal of the process is reached, namely the albedo, tinctura alba, terra alba foliata, lapis albus, etc., highly prized by many alchemists as if it were the ultimate goal. It is the silver or moon condition, which still has to be raised to the sun condition. The albedo is, so to speak, the daybreak, but not till the rubedo is it sunrise. The transition to the rubedo is formed by the citrinitas, though this, as we have said, was omitted later. The rubedo then follows direct from the albedo as the result of raising the heat of the fire to its highest intensity. The red and the white are King and Queen, who may also celebrate their ‚Äúchymical wedding‚Äù at this stage.

  The prima materia was thought of as an ever-changing substance, or else as the essence or soul of that substance. It was designated with the name ‚ÄúMercurius,‚Äù and was conceived as a paradoxical double being called monstrum, hermaphroditus, or rebis. The lapis-Christ parallel establishes an analogy between the transforming substance and Christ, in the Middle Ages doubtless under the influence of the doctrine of transubstantiation, though in earlier times the Gnostic tradition of older pagan ideas was the dominant factor. Mercurius is likened to the serpent hung on the cross (John 3 : 14), to mention only one of the numerous parallels.

  The ‚ÄúCantilena‚Äù ends with the apotheosis of the virgin-mother. This the above-mentioned Pandora depicts as a glorification of Mary, the assumptio Beatae Mariae Virginis. After her death, by a divine miracle her body was again united with her soul and both together were taken up to heaven. This has long been the view of the Church, although it has only recently been promulgated as a dogma. (In fig. 232) she is marked with the words ‚Äúterra‚Äù and ‚Äúcorpus Lyb‚Äù (body) and ‚Äúdie wonn der jung-frowenn wardt‚Äù (who became the joy of virgins); the dove descends upon her, and God the Father touches her with his right hand in benison. She is crowned. The figure of God holding the orb is inscribed ‚ÄúAnima Seel‚Äù and ‚ÄúJesse pater, filius et mater.‚Äù ‚ÄúMater‚Äù refers to the Queen of Heaven enthroned beside him, the King; for in her the earth substance, becoming transfigured in her resurrected body, is absorbed into the Godhead. On the left is a bearded figure equal in rank to God the Father, inscribed ‚ÄúSapientia Wyssheit.‚Äù In the shield below there is a picture of the rebis being freed from the prima materia.

  In the stone, as we know, the chaotic antagonism of the elements is replaced by the most intense mutual alliance, which is what makes the stone incorruptible, this being the reason why, in our author‚Äôs opinion, it has the same effect as the blood of the Saviour: ‚Äúsanitas atque vita diuturna in foelicitate, propter quam praecipue lapis noster est petendus‚Äù (health and long life in felicity, on account of which our stone is chiefly to be sought).

  Therefore Mercurius philosophorum is to be considered a spiritual body, as the philosophers call him. From God the Father was born his own Son Jesus Christ, who is God and man, and is without sin, and who also had no need to die. But he died of his own free will, and rose again for the sake of his brothers and sisters, that they might live with him without sin for ever. So, too, is the gold without flaw, and is fixed, potent to withstand all examinations, and glorious; yet, for the sake of its imperfect and sick brothers and sisters, it dies and rises again, glorious and redeemed, and tinctures them to eternal life, making them perfect like to pure gold.

  It is clear enough from this material what the ultimate aim of alchemy really was: it was trying to produce a corpus subtile, a transfigured and resurrected body, i.e., a body that was at the same time spirit. In this it finds common ground with Chinese alchemy, as we have learned from The Secret of the Golden Flower. There the main concern is the ‚Äúdiamond body,‚Äù in other words, the attainment of immortality through the transformation of the body. The diamond is an excellent symbol because it is hard, fiery, and translucent. Orthelius tells us that the philosophers have never found a better medicament than that which they called the noble and blessed stone of the philosophers, on account of its hardness, transparency, and rubeous hue.

Here we are to apply this concept on Shadow Lairs, we propose a following correspondence.

Isorans crash land on Cradle due to their search of an energy source, which is the Core. Paralleling to it an idea introduced by knights starting to feel as if they were intended to crash land.

Then there are the materials. We suggest an existence of a parallel in the materials acquired in the Sanctuary depending on the Shadow Lair, and stages of the Work. The three prior materials represent the alchemical stages - a metaphorical process of transformation of Prima Materia. This symbolism is depicted in the [Nightmare Mane](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nightmare_Mane) - being the blackening, [Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore) - the whitening, and then to [Gremlonium](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlonium) - the reddening. [Gremlonium](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlonium) - `A highly advanced compound created by gremlin engineers to power their most devious machines`, seems to be a red powder, which is the same as powder of projection in 12-step process of Great Work.

Then, there is [Maiden's Tear](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maiden%27s_Tear), it is a sacred jewel, and, we believe, in conjunction with the theme of fire due to traversal of the Shadow Firestorm Citadel, serves as the metaphorical crucible for the creation of the Great Work of Prime Matter, referring to Isorans, literally being forged - prepared, - to take on the Swarm. Firestorm Citadel serves as the fire of `highest intensity`, from which Maiden's Tear, a sacred jewel, finally emerges. It is the representation of the reunion of 2 Isoran pasts - one of Isora, and one of Almire, - symbolized by the alchemical path of the Almirian Crusader set, as reunion of the known, or conscious, - Isora from where their thought-to-be-destined journey begins; and unknown, of the unconscious, of Almire.

In additional, while potentially misleading, component to this proposal is the arrangement of Red King and White Queen who through the metaphor of union create the divine Rebis. Within the cosmology of Spiral Knights there are such figures: the supposed genius king Tinkinzar, associated with the Crimson Order, and Spirit Mother, which we propose to be a divine and benevolent entity, closely related to Almire, who can be consider as White - the White Queen, is the unity of both requiring to achieve an enlightened or complete state of being. But, this endeavour would fail manifested as the Swarm, - currently a speculation, but one we will provide substance throughout the following analysis of the Swarm.

#### The Swarm

Architect-Core-Cradle-Sleeper relation must be looked at through the lens of narrative analysis and themes, in conjunction with the events - arcs and themes, - preceding the Clockworks.

##### Location of a Breach into the Core

We will begin from the though, suggesting that the Swarm was within the Core this entire time, taken at face value:

- `The recon module you collected is very strange. I have no reason to believe what Parma was saying isn't true, but how it happened I just can't say. Everything about the Core suggests there are no 'doors' into it. its not a structure built to enter from the outside. Rather, it seems just the opposite` ([The Search Continues - Vaelyn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vaelyn)).
- `If the Core isn't kept sealed The Swarm will escape and it will continue to consume everything and everyone.` ([Dreams and Nightmares - Parma's Scout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vaelyn))
- `Who could have guessed that this 'Swarm' was just waiting for someone to stumble across the Core and free it?` ([Delved Too Deep - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kora)).
- `Such power! I never imagined...! ...and it will be unleashed. You! I will make you its first victims` [Dreams and Nightmares - The Path is Revealed - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/The_Path_is_Revealed).

But then a question arises - how the Swarm was able to feed on Core while sealed within, when it is directly encountered in the most active to date state within the Shadow Lairs? And, with an access elevator to Sanctuary from the [Unknown Passage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Unknown_Passage)? Essentially, the question is - where is the Swarm coming from, from the inside of the Core or from the Shadow Lairs?

As Parma told, the Swarm breached the Core - `We've taken to calling it The Sleeper. We aren't sure what it is exactly, but it needs our help. This world was created to protect it but somehow The Swarm breached the Core and has been feeding on the energy and growing like a leech ever since` ([Dreams and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge)), leading to a conclusion of reachability of the power source under normal conditions of Core being sealed. If power source is located outside of the Core, the Swarm had no reason to breach it?

Despite the location, where the Swarm had originated, outside or within the Core, the breach should serve as a connection between the Core and the rest of the world. Here we propose a potential solution, to one which we will return to analyze in detail and how it applies to both cases of Swarm's location - the entrance to the Sanctuary in the end of the unknown Passage is the breach, Parma had spoken of.

As Unknown Passage ends, already in the most severe destroyed state of Clockwork tunnel within the skydome, the elevator to the Sanctuary is completely cut off. If the Sanctuary is located within the Core, which will assume for now, but wll also discuss, this elevator should by that logic go through the breach.

By that logic the Sanctuary is to be located within the Core.

The space beyond mechanical skydome of Clockworks design is pure white, nowhere else we find design as such outside of the Core's [Refuge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge).

If the skydome was outside of the Core, Spiral HQ surely would notice such tremendous amount of energy cycling through the Clockworks. Yet, it could be shaded by the Swarm, as in case of other locations residing in the Shadow Lairs, but, considering the theme of Whitespace and Refuge, we are confident that the Sanctuary is within the Core, as it is stated to be safe (`YOU ARE SAFE HERE, KNIGHT. WITHIN THIS DREAM, ITS MANY EYES CANNOT SEE YOU NOR CAN ITS MANY ARMS REACH YOU.` - [Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods)), is it has a limited capacity to repel the Swarm, as suggested by Parma: `The Swarm breached the Core and has been feeding on the energy and growing like a leech ever since. ... The Swarm keeps growing stronger while The Sleeper grows weaker` ([Dreams and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge)).

Here we have to bring up previous idea of Shadow Firestorm Citadel, as its unknown Passage leads to the Sanctuary, - this does not seem to thematically fit with the events of Dreams and Nightmares, as by that time the name of Swarm would be revealed.

Then it is the proposal of Sanctuary located outside of the Core. Spiral HQ has the technology to detect surges of energy and accompanied consoles' activation. But, they hadn't noticed anything apart from energy surges by activation of Consoles during and relatively prior to the main rank missions.

There is a question then - how HQ had not discovered Darkfire Firestorm Citadel? It must be somewhere in the Shadow Lairs, but it seems that they would not if not for the proximity to the Core and Recon Knights: `But now some kind of massive negative energy anomaly has surfaced above the Core, blocking access to it` ([Ending in Fire - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kora)).

Sanctuary skydome can potentially be hidden within Cradle's volume but, as mentioned, it would be thematically incorrect for 2 identical location being located outside and inside the Core under the current cosmology. Yet, we have to discuss weather Unknown passage is located in the Core, and by extensions, Shadow Lair, as lon as their is vagueness, those possibilities should not be removed completely.

Whitespace design is nowhere present except the Core, as we explore them in [Dreams and Nightmares](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_nightmares). [Refuge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge), despite having a Core elevator icon, has the same design of skydome as the Sanctuary and Whitespace blocks. The question is then: why the Sanctuary has a different elevator icon? For this we have to hold on to the idea of a Dream as a tangible concept, which refers to a physical space.

At current point, Swarm's location can be interpreted in 2 ways:

1. The Swarm is located within the Core. Then it breaching the Core means getting outside of the Core.

   It is visibly present on the outside as in the events of Shadow Lairs and It Came From Below's Into The Maw. As the depth's name of Descend into Darkness is used twice - in the context of [Dreams and Nightmares](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Descent_into_Darkness) and of [Unknown Passage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/It_Came_From_Below#Gate_Map) preceded by [Into the Maw](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/It_Came_From_Below/Into_the_Maw). We won't discard the potential for Shadow Lair being in the Core.

   This part of the Swarm could be the one escaping from the Core through the breach - this Swarm feeds of the energy from outside of the Core as if its internals do not provide it the means to persist. The distinction here is made between energy presence across power complexes and wires, and the Whitespace of the Core.

   Yet, it was stated that Swarm was mirroring itself within the Dream:

   `IT GREW STRONGER, ENDLESSLY MIRRORING ITSELF WITHIN THE SPACE OF MY DREAM. ENDLESSLY MIRRORING... EXPANDING... INFINITE.` ([Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel))

   We will keep this concept of a Dream and act of mirroring in mind. One thing is certain here, the only deific entity, related to themes of Whitespace is the Sleeper due to lack of any other contestants, as well as this entity being the only one referring to the Swarm only through interaction with the Sleeper:

   - `WHAT IT WAS BEFORE IT IS NO MORE. NEITHER BEAST NOR GOD, IT IS A CREATION UNLIKE ALL. IT IS... THE SWARM.` ([Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel)).
   - `he fell while protecting us from The Swarm. He stood his ground even when the rest of us were forced to flee. ... But then...then the light surrounded us and we were safe. We've taken to calling it The Sleeper. We aren't sure what it is exactly, but it needs our help. This world was created to protect it but somehow The Swarm breached the Core and has been feeding on the energy and growing like a leech ever since.` ([Dreams and Nightmare - Refuge - Parma's Scout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Refuge)).

2. The Swarm is located in the Clockworks outside of the Core, within the stratum of Unknown Passage or the Shadow Lairs generally. Breaching the Core in that context means entering it from the outside, and feeding on energy within the Core, the Whitespace.

   As the event of [Dreams and Nightmares](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares) suggest, Swarm's concentration within the Core is seen in lesser amount, yet [growing by the depth](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Descent_into_Darkness), at least by fact of currently absent [Swarm Sources](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Swarm#Swarm_Source).

##### Sleeper's location, Sanctuary, Refuge

The Sanctuary [Echo Stones](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone#Echo_Stone) tell:

`I DREAM... WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER. YOU ARE SAFE HERE, KNIGHT. WITHIN THIS DREAM, ITS MANY EYES CANNOT SEE YOU NOR CAN ITS MANY ARMS REACH YOU.` ([Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods))

The punctuation is crucial here. A void opened not within the dream, but the Sleeper saw the void opening from his dreaming state.

Despite it, the Dream placement must be questioned - what and where is it? Is it the Core, metaphysical state, Cradle, or the Sanctuary skydome? The latter is of particular interest, as in the context of entering the Sanctuary for the first time, from the Shadow Gloaming Wildwoods, which was initially the first unlocked Lair (`Shadow Lairs are grouped into three ranks. All knights with Tier 3 clearance automatically gain Shadow Lair Clearance 1. Completing a Shadow Lair Rank 1 earns you clearance into the next rank and so on.` - [Release Notes: 2011.10.19](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2011-10-19)), it is the Sanctuary which is referred to as a `fleeting dream`.

There're mentions of a Dream in other instances:

- `I DREAM ... WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER.` ([Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods))
- `WITHIN THIS DREAM, ITS MANY EYES CANNOT SEE YOU NOR CAN ITS MANY ARMS REACH YOU.` ([Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods))
- `BUT THIS DREAM IS FLEETING. USE WHAT IS HERE TO PREPARE FOR THE BATTLE TO COME.` ([Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods))
- `I DREAM ... WITHIN MY DREAM I SEE YOUR LEGION FALLING TO THIS WORLD LIKE BURNING STARS.` ([Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Royal_Jelly_Palace))
- `IT GREW STRONGER, ENDLESSLY MIRRORING ITSELF WITHIN THE SPACE OF MY DREAM.` ([Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel))

The Sleeper's `my dream` and `this dream` are places, potentially separated spatially, and possibly, temporally, as the Sleeper talks about the Swarm in the past tense - `I SAW`, `FELT`, `IT GREW`, but also in the present - `USE WHAT IS HERE`, `I SEE YOUR LEGION`. The structure of the sentence suggests, that the Sleeper is not sleeping during the event of the game, as only 2 Echo stones specifically say the Sleeper is dreaming, [Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Royal_Jelly_Palace) and [Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel) seem more like statements, more direct and urgent. This pattern seems intentional, as if the Sleeper was weakened by the time it awakened by the Swarm as it "breached" the Core, which is confirmed by Parma: `The Swarm keeps growing stronger while The Sleeper grows weaker` ([Parma's Scout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge)).

In that interpretation, the `fleeting dream` is Sleeper's `my dream`, from which it seemingly awakens, or at least capable to communicate. It seems correct to assume that the place where Sleeper is - a proposal of it being the Sanctuary, as the most fortified against influence of the Swarm, - leads to an idea that Sleeper is in the Sanctuary. Yet, which only narrows the identity of a Dream. For that we have to look at a different word - the world.

##### Sleeper's definition of the World

The World is mentioned several times across Echo Stones:

- `WITHIN MY DREAM I SEE YOUR LEGION FALLING TO THIS WORLD LIKE BURNING STARS.` ([Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Royal_Jelly_Palace)).
- `THIS WORLD WAS CREATED TO PROTECT ME` (Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory).
- `VULNERABLE IN SLUMBER, WORLDS WERE DRAWN TO SHIELD ME FROM THE DARKNESS.` ([Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory))
- `THIS WORLD HAS BECOME MY PRISON.` ([Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory)).

Those quotes make seem like the word "world" refers both to Cradle and the "worlds" contained within the skydomes. But how they were drawn to shield the Sleeper, except through the rotation within the clockworks? Does this mean that Cradle itself as an entity separate from the Core?

This gives another clue to Sleeper's physical location, - within the Core - the Sanctuary specifically, or being the Core. The Core at the Core Terminal does not seem particularly large, seemingly capable of containing a single skydome. This raises the question of plausibility of Refuge and Sanctuary being different locations.

With the established physics of Whitespace, it is capable of manifesting matter - Whitespace blocks, out of "nothing", - could it be that the volume of the Core is far larger than it is perceived on the outside?

Notably, behavior of Whitespace is similar to the [Ghost Blocks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghost_Block#Ghost_Block). Ghost Blocks have a light-blue glow of the Core and Artifact, while having a depiction of curse to the one on gremlin Collector's back. We don't currently know of its meaning apart from possessing a capacity to make matter disappear.

If, hypothetically, the Whitespace of the Core is infinite, how Sleeper could grow weaker within the infinite volume? It might be that the Sanctuary is finite, defined by its skydome, and it is within an infinite space of literal white space of the Core. Within this logic, the Whitespace would be only entity accompanied Sleeper and contained within the Core, meaning that it is the source of energy. The idea of infinite space of Whitespace can be suggested by the Echo Stone:

`IT GREW STRONGER, ENDLESSLY MIRRORING ITSELF WITHIN THE SPACE OF MY DREAM. ENDLESSLY MIRRORING... EXPANDING... INFINITE.` ([Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel))

If this statement is taken literally, does that mean, that Whitespace is a different realm, or at least at its border, as skydome and regular matter clearly exists intact?

While the Dream is either the Core or Whitespace or the Sanctuary, option of skydome being the Sleeper's dream presents an opportunity for a World to be referring either to Cradle or Core's artificial shell and above, including Cradle. We know that the worlds referred to, are ones in skydomes, and the world in general implies Cradle, so this might in fact solidify a suggestion that the Sleeper is within the Sanctuary, the only safe place, as stated by itself as well as by lack of the Swarm in [Dreams and Nightmares](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge) while being followed by it in [Descent into Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Descent_into_Darkness):

`YOU ARE SAFE HERE, KNIGHT. WITHIN THIS DREAM, ITS MANY EYES CANNOT SEE YOU NOR CAN ITS MANY ARMS REACH YOU.` ([Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods))

The phrasing `NOR CAN ITS MANY ARMS REACH YOU` is similar to the following lines:

- `I lost sight of him as things went black. It felt like a thousand hands were pulling us away. As if something didn't want us to follow` [Dreams and Nightmares - A Step Beyond - Vaelyn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vaelyn).
- `Luckily I was able to pull some strings and find you an exit` [Dreams and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge) - the scenario of ending up within the skydome of the Core is familiar to the Shadow Lairs leading to Sanctuary.

  Since the latter mission was before the Core opening, it is quite possible, the the Sleeper or the same Alpha Squad member, through the breach, arranged for the Knight to enter the Sanctuary. Sleeper there mentions through the Echo Stone: `YOU ARE SAFE HERE, KNIGHT. WITHIN THIS DREAM, ITS MANY EYES CANNOT SEE YOU NOR CAN ITS MANY ARMS REACH YOU.` ([Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods)).

This wording makes it seem like the "arms" are reaching from the outside, and, considering that in both current scenarios knight escapes into the whitespace, it seems that the arms are outside of the Core. The only reason why arms would be present if they were preventing anyone entering the Core. Swarm, with its current goals (`IT DEVOURED THE KNOWLEDGE OF TIME... MEMORIES OF THE DEAD... THE HEARTS OF KINGS AND THE SOULS OF THEIR PEOPLE... GOOD AND EVIL... IT CONSUMED.` - [Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel)), had no reason to prevent anyone, if it does not present a danger to it. This is an argument for Swarms location being in the Core in its fullest extent, but not the Shadow Lairs themselves, if we consider Unknown Passage being above the Core during [It Came From Below](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/It_Came_From_Below/Into_the_Maw).

Parma mentions of exit: `I knew I'd never make it here in time when I noticed your signal. Luckily I was able to pull some strings and find you an exit` ([Dreams and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge)). It suggests that the knight and Vaelyn were in danger, as evident by higher Swarm presence, as well as by the naming of the prior depth - [Descent into Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Descent_into_Darkness). Yet, we can not rely on depth identification - as evident by [Refuge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Refuge) being at depth 28, above Core Terminal of depth 29. This and the multiple meaning of the Descend Into Darkness make it difficult to identify without relying on the subjective perception of themes.

##### Sleeper's definition of a Dream

Now with that paradigm, we return to the question of the Dream - what it is, and then, where is the Swarm.

1. If the Dream is the white skydome of Sanctuary/Refuge, and the Swarm remains within the Core, seeping into the Clockworks, the Whitespace could be considered near Swarm's source as the Swarm can't reach the Sanctuary.

   But, we encounter a gameplay mechanic - the map. The map, compared to the [Unknown Passage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Unknown_Passage), is not obscured within the Core, as well as we do not observe [Swarm Sources](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Swarm#Swarm_Source) within the Whitespace of [A Step Beyond](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/A_Step_Beyond).

   Swarm's concentration without Swarm Source reaches local high at [Descent into Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Descent_into_Darkness). There is a different question of: does this mean that the Swarm was sieging the Sanctuary/Refuge skydome, where the Sleeper is supposedly located?
   this seems as plausible explanation, which would also explain weakness of Sleeper and a possibility of Swarm expanding infinite. Weather seemingly infinite energy output of the Core, consumed by the Swarm, would make Sleeper weaker, currently is unknown, as we are unaware of Whitespace's exact composition.

2. Dream is the Core with Whitespace, Swarm is external.

   In that case we have a scenario, where Swarm and the Sleeper exist in-place together within a single Dream, as the "this" Dream stated to be unreachable by the Swarm, while it breaches the Core from the Clockworks, and mirrors itself within its space - mirroring itself within the Whitespace.

   This approach may seem less straightforward, considering Vaelyn, Kora, and Parma's dialogues, suggesting that the Swarm is in the Core. So we can suggest a following option.

   The Core and the Cradle are referred to as the World and the 'my dream', as Sleeper slept through construction of Clockworks or a dream of protection. Namely `VULNERABLE IN SLUMBER` means that it was not protected, until `WORLDS WERE DRAWN TO SHIELD ME FROM THE DARKNESS` - protected by Cradle and its worlds ([Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory)).

   Cradle was created to protect Sleeper. Where Vaelyn was right and [Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory) tell, it became a prison in a sense that the Sleeper was imprisoned at by Architect.

In that context, the Core being sealed is an act of imprisonment, but one suggested to be a short term solution, as due to presence of Swarm, now it is detrimental. Crimson Order at that seem to uphold this status quo by the fact of Herex's secrecy and his perception of them being the fault one.

The Core could not be built momentarily, as its physicality is of material realm. It would be part of protection originally build with the Cradle, but now the Core and the Cradle are a prison:

`IN HIS MADNESS, THE ARCHITECT BETRAYED THE PACT. TWISTING HIS CREATION INTO A GAME OF DEATH, IT NOW DEVOURS ALL WHO ENTER ITS IRON EMBRACE.` ([Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory))

The `IT` term in the [Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel) - `AS I DREAMED, IT CONSUMED. ... IT GREW STRONGER, ENDLESSLY MIRRORING ITSELF WITHIN THE SPACE OF MY DREAM.` - makes it seem that the Swarm was getting stronger inside the the space which is occupied by or is the same as the dream - `THE SPACE OF MY DREAM`. It is plausible if we think of the Dream being not the Sanctuary, but on the contrary, the Core with its Whitespace contained - for example, a definition of a space under Sleeper's authority over matter. This idea ties to a the fact that Swarm was feeding on Core's energy, mirroring itself either within it - the Whitespace.

The term of mirroring if interpreted, would mean presence of mirrors in a confinement. Such confinement being the Whitespace within the Core. Or, if Dream's space being Cradle, the mirrorings would be then the Shadow Lairs. But as Sleeper is weaker, and refers to the dream as Sanctuary, we suggest that the Swarm's mirroring was also within the Core, as the endlessness of Whitespace and a concept of unlimited power source to feed upon.

- `WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER.` (Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods).
- `WITHIN MY DREAM I SEE YOUR LEGION FALLING TO THIS WORLD LIKE BURNING STARS.` (Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace).

Based on this we come to the following conclusions:

- The Sleeper is safe within the Sanctuary, his dream - a constructed skydome within Core's Whitespace, which initially was the totality of Whitespace, essentially being a volume of Sleeper's security.
- Whitespace itself is infinite and is the source of Energy. The space taken buy the Whitespace is surrounded by the Core to interact with it in controlled manner, as proven by presence of Consoles, with the Clockworks and to power them. Consoles are capable of opening Core's hatch when charged Artifact is inserted.
- The Sleeper is within the Sanctuary, as mentioned - constructed as a regular skydome of Clockworks for a reason, and an only place to contain grass and water, as well as exit from the Core.

From Core's sealed state, Sanctuary and entities within are capable of limited control over Core's operation, accessing Core internal space, as Parma managed to find an exit to the Refuge. An exit in that sense, from infinity of Whitespace, which as it got deeper, was the more occupied by the Swarm. Connection to the rest of Clockworks from within the Core would not be possible then, or at least by a small degree, as suggested by Whitespace blocks at Sanctuary elevator.

But the Core's sealed state does not mean the sleeping state of Sleeper, as it was already sleeping yet before Architect's betrayal, that is `VULNERABLE IN SLUMBER, WORLDS WERE DRAWN TO SHIELD ME FROM THE DARKNESS.` (Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory). The Swarm feed of Whitespace, but once the Core was sealed, the Swarm was severed from it, which led it to breach it.

The Swarm was trapped within infinite Whitespace, while the external part managed to breach the Core and maintain itself, slowly expanding, as shown by movement of Unknown Passage in [It Came From Below](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/It_Came_From_Below).

##### Sleeper's definition of the Pact

It is implied that gremlins had an assistance in building Clockworks. As in Whitespace it was seen to be possible to manifest matter, and, potentially, Divine Clockwork tunnels, based of its transition into the abstract. Would this mean that the concept of Swarm mirroring itself is Sleeper's term for not specifically multiplication, but creation? As it is the only instance of Swarm gaining power with the exactness of the method it gains it, we suggest it being the metaphor for creation.

`WHAT IT WAS BEFORE IT IS NO MORE. NEITHER BEAST NOR GOD, IT IS A CREATION UNLIKE ALL.` (Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel).

This establishes a state preceding the current one. The term Creation will be looked at shortly.

The Swarm source within the Core was, while sealed, expanding with the direct access to the energy of the Core/Whitespace. In that interpretation, the Swarm on the outside would attempt entering itself, as it requires Energy to sustain itself. There is a possibility of that somebody intersecting into a relation of Swarm within the Whitespace and Sleeper, as it is told by Sleeper: `IT KNOWS OF YOU NOW. IT WILL FIND A WAY OUT AND COME FOR YOU` (Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods), but it may also be a consequence of attempting to enter the Core by anybody except the Swarm as a potential threat to its plan to escape the Core, as well as a potential foreshadowing of its raising activity in [It Came From Below](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/It_Came_From_Below), prior to activation of the second console.

With this theory we found at least one loose end: if the Whitespace is under control of the Swarm, while the Sanctuary hadn't already fallen? Yet we observe its exterior - one behind the skydome, - as pure white. Could the be another consequence of Whitespace being infinite within the Core?

`IN HIS MADNESS, THE ARCHITECT BETRAYED THE PACT.` (Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory)

The Pact between the Sleeper and the Architect is struck. Betrayal of the Pact resulted in the current status quo of Core being Sealed, with `THIS WORLD HAS BECOME MY PRISON.` and `TWISTING HIS CREATION INTO A GAME OF DEATH, IT NOW DEVOURS ALL WHO ENTER ITS IRON EMBRACE.` (Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory)

based on this we can gather, that the Pact had involved transformation of creation of Cradle into a mechanized fortress. Gremlins would inhabit and, at least, maintain its defenses.

We suggest it also being form Gremlins' perspective known as the Iron Law, due to its significance to Herex: `The Iron Law is Broken` ([Spark and Roar - Hidden Hideout - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hidden_Hideout)). This state of brokenness is characterized by supposed falsehood of Crimson Order: `The Crimson Order is False! The Nine are blind, they cannot see the Truth that lies below. The Nine are deaf, they cannot hear the Resonance that beats within this world` ([Spark and Roar - Hidden Hideout - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hidden_Hideout)).

By that, maintenance of the Pact, of ones upholding it - the Crimson Order, - is an incorrect position. The Truth and the Resonance could be referring to anything that comprises the Core - as it is called the heart of the World, - be it the Swarm, Whitespace, or the Sleeper.

The current condition of Cradle is one of broken Iron Law from Herex's perspective, and of broken Pact from the perspective of Sleeper, with the Core being currently sealed as a measure. And yet, the Core must be kept sealed for the Swarm not to escape.

We suggest a plausible explanation, which allows to resolve those conflicts - Iron Law is the idea of Core remaining sealed - a crisis-control measure to prevent Swarm from escaping, - as Crimson Oder supposedly did hide the Artifact prior to Skylark crash landing.

Through connections:

- `TWISTING HIS CREATION INTO A GAME OF DEATH, IT NOW DEVOURS ALL WHO ENTER ITS IRON EMBRACE.` (Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory).
- `WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER.` (Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods).

We suggest that the Sleeper was sleeping during the Pact breakage, as shields were drawn, and Cradle constructed. And as it was broken, the Swarm or rather the entity before it, if we consider it as `IT`, `opened the void`, and was consumed by it. As a result, it then hungered for everything, including Core's energy in a way, which had to be taken care of: `IT GREW STRONGER, ENDLESSLY MIRRORING ITSELF WITHIN THE SPACE OF MY DREAM. ENDLESSLY MIRRORING... EXPANDING... INFINITE.` (Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel). And, through this affliction by the void and its hunger it came to its the current physicality: `WHAT IT WAS BEFORE IT IS NO MORE. NEITHER BEAST NOR GOD, IT IS A CREATION UNLIKE ALL.` (Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel).

It was transformed into the malevolent entity, as no danger prior to it, apart from abstract darkness, was present, - not within the `WORLDS WERE DRAWN TO SHIELD ME FROM THE DARKNESS.` (Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory) At that, the Iron Law can be related to Sleeper's term of Iron Prison as Cradle and the Core, but mirroring its meaning.

Through this logic, we can propose, tha the entity suspected to help construct the Clockworks is the initial, non-malevolent precursor of the Swarm, shared with the Whitespace by the fact of rectangular, similar, abstract design - we wll return to ths design in the context of the Void and its effects. Within this thought framework, it would mean that the Swarm found in the Shadow Lairs is the part of greater whole, sealed in the Core, essentially of the nature of Whitespace.

The scenario of the Core had to be sealed seem to be the case of a temporary solution, which, while allowing to contain the Swarm, imprisoned with it Sleeper itself, if we interpret the words `IT GREW STRONGER, ENDLESSLY MIRRORING ITSELF WITHIN THE SPACE OF MY DREAM. ENDLESSLY MIRRORING... EXPANDING... INFINITE.` (Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel), paired with the Dream being the volume of the Core, as a sign of is being within the Core.

##### The Void: Part 2

For the first time alchemical motif was introduced in the general analysis of the [Nameless Realm](#nameless-realm) as it had its dual nature of chaos and elements converging in the same manner as the alchemical primordial chaos of the First Matter, also introduced there and then as the Round Chaos of Mercurius - [expanded](#alchemical-symbolism-of-shadow-lairs-great-work-and-rebis) in the symbolic relation to Shadow Lairs.

The Void is encountered physically once - as the identity of shadow enemies emerging from Swarm portals. The death of those entities signs at their distinct metaphysics, separate from the material realm.

We can suggest, that some aspect of either Void or Whitespace is responsible for this ability either to influence - consume, - or to completely replicate living beings. We are not aware, weather this ability undeniably belongs to he Void, as covered in [Divine and Whitespace Clockworks](#divine-and-whitespace-clockworks), it seems that Whitespace is capable of manufacturing the tunnels, unless those are depicted as consumed by Whitespaces, being abstracted away. This concept can be plausible in Theory of Forms, brought to the fundamental Form within the "higher" realm of Whitespace or further beyond, serving its distinct purpose of transporting from point A to point B.

On the other hand, within our earlier logic, entity of Whitespace had to be that form of assistance during Clockworks' construction. Here we would argue for Whitespace and Nameless realm being close, but due to how Whitespace is depicted as ordered and likely with a relation to the divine, we can't state this, unless, they are related as Underworld and Blinding Abyss by being metaphysically nearby each other.

If Whitespace itself is incapable of creating tunnels from Whitespace we have more arguments in favour of the Void being the alchemical Void. Before further analysis we will elaborate on the alchemical meaning of the Void, as one being of the same nature as First Matter. In that context it is known as the Round Chaos ("Psychology and Alchemy" - Carl Jung):

<BookCitation source="Psychology and Alchemy - Carl Jung">
  {#snippet markup()}

  The prima materia has the quality of ubiquity: it can be found always and everywhere, which is to say that projection can take place always and everywhere. The English alchemist Sir George Ripley writes: ‚ÄúThe philosophers tell the inquirer that birds and fishes bring us the lapis, every man has it, it is in every place, in you, in me, in everything, in time and space.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt offers itself in lowly form [vili figura]. From it there springs our eternal water [aqua permanens].‚Äù According to Ripley the prima materia is water; it is the material principle of all bodies, including mercury. It is the hyle which the divine act of creation brought forth from the chaos as a dark sphere. The chaos is a massa confusa that gives birth to the stone. The hylical water contains a hidden elemental fire. In the treatise ‚ÄúDe sulphure‚Äù hell-fire (ignis gehennalis) is attributed to the element earth as its inner opposite. According to Hortulanus, the stone arises from a massa confusa containing in itself all the elements. Just as the world came forth from a chaos confusum, so does the stone. The idea of the rotating aquasphere reminds us of the Neopythagoreans: in Archytas the world-soul is a circle or sphere; in Philolaos it draws the world round with it in its rotation. The original idea is to be found in Anaxagoras, where the nous gives rise to a whirlpool in chaos. The cosmogony of Empedokles is also relevant: here the œÉœïŒ±ƒ´œÅŒøœÇ (spherical being) springs from the union of dissimilars, owing to the influence of œïŒπŒªŒØŒ±. The definition of this spherical being as , ‚Äúthe most serene God,‚Äù sheds a special light on the perfect, ‚Äúround‚Äù nature of the lapis, which arises from, and constitutes, the primal sphere; hence the prima materia is often called lapis. The initial state is the hidden state, but by the art and the grace of God it can be transmuted into the second, manifest state. ... It is the black, magically fecund earth that Adam took with him from Paradise, also called antimony and described as a ‚Äúblack blacker than black‚Äù (nigrum nigrius nigro).

</BookCitation>

Form this emerges a concept of god Mercurius, standing on the round chaos, or, the void. Form this a following idea can be established: The Void of Spiral Knights is the alchemical Void, equalling the round Chaos. Then, it has similar nature to the Nameless Realm, as both represent First Matter in different perspectives. Moreover, both realms are related to [evil eye](#evil-eye) symbolism.

- In relation to the Nameless Realm, [Chaos Cloak]() encompasses curse, whish is the one of pillars of the evil eye symbolism across Cradle, - as one of elements within Nameless Realm. The Cloak has a depicted an antique evil eye on its front.
- In relation to the Void, eye symbolism is present within the Swarm, most prominently on the symbology of Shadow Lair elevators and the Swarm entity.

Nameless Realm and the Void are both framed in a similar, dangerous, manner:

- The mantle - [Chaos Cloak](), - is forbidden across Owlites: `A forbidden mantle said to grant the wearer protection within the nameless realm where all elements are said to converge into one and divide into all.` ([Chaos Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_Cloak)).
- The Void has hunger, which can be felt by one "opening" it, in our case it is the entity which eventually became the Swarm: `WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER.` ([Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods)).

We will focus on this concept of opening the Void and of hunger in mind and attempt to understand it in two steps. First, we will adhere to the idea of the Void being of similar nature to the alchemical Void, - the themes and concepts of this justification will be introduces throughout this section, where they seem to be thematically fitting and make relatively reasonable, mostly symbolic, connections. Then, we will attempt to interpret whose findings within the context of Spiral Knights cosmology. The third steps consists of the aligning those concepts with the real-world mythology in order to find matching narratives or other patterns.

It seems that the Void is one potential catalyst for the transpiring events, relating to `IN HIS MADNESS, THE ARCHITECT BETRAYED THE PACT.` (Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory).

The alchemical Void is the Prime Matter, from which, through alchemical transmutation, anything can be created by the alchemist. Here, most of material realm entities - enemies, - are connected to this potential void by Swarm dur to their presence in the [Unknown Passage]() and other infested by the Swarm Clockwork depths, and the Core. This connection stems from the fact that those entities seemingly are, by the time they are found, possess this void-like or Swarm-like nature, are called as such, and on death perish in the same manner as other Swarm-related entities. This could be either a case of Swarm consuming and transforming living entities from Clockworks, or a case of Swarm creating them in the image of the consumed originals.

As for the first scenario, we can assume that Swarm is unable to consume perished entities, judging of the gremlins in the beginning of the Unknown Passage. The second scenario is still physically possible, and potentially exists due to the term used by the Sleeper in relation to Swarm's expansion: `IT GREW STRONGER, ENDLESSLY MIRRORING ITSELF WITHIN THE SPACE OF MY DREAM.`

Alchemical Void has a chaotic aspect, which was closely similar to the chaos of [Dark matter](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Matter#Dark_Matter): `dark and ominous in color said to contain the essences of both chaos and nothingness`. Then there is the instinctive intent of hunger - the hunger of the void: `IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER` (Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods). This hunger is attributed to the void as if it was Void's integral property.

##### The Void: Part 3

It is implied that the Swarm originated with Architect's maddening betrayal, and as discussed earlier, themes of hunger are present here, as in:

- `WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER.` [Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](). It corresponds directly to the Void, and potentially Swarm, as it felt the hunger.
- `TWISTING HIS CREATION INTO A GAME OF DEATH, IT NOW DEVOURS ALL WHO ENTER ITS IRON EMBRACE.` [Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](). If coupled with the previous idea, then it is the Swarm which devours, apart fom Clockworks themselves.
- The name of second depth of [It Came From Below]() - [`Into the Maw`]() - is a direct metaphor on the entrance to the Unknown Passage, as it is the first direct encounter with the Swarm across rank missions. This establishes a metaphor of the Swarm being a beast, into whose maw knights descend.
- Earlier organic themes of the Core, covered in the [Core Terminal section](#core-terminal), identifying it to the nerve center - as Vaelyn: `asd`, and a heart - as Sleeper: `asd`.

It is suggested, that Cradle itself was twisted, or changed, to devour everything. Cradle is creation of Architect, who is implied gremlin king (`Tinkinzar is said to be a great ruler and mechanical genius, responsible for the vision of the whole Clockworks.` [Bootshuze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Bootshuze)).

-`IN HIS MADNESS, THE ARCHITECT BETRAYED THE PACT.` (Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory)

- `THIS WORLD WAS CREATED TO PROTECT ME. VULNERABLE IN SLUMBER, WORLDS WERE DRAWN TO SHIELD ME FROM THE DARKNESS.` (Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory)
- `I've felt it since we first set foot on this world; invisible eyes watching our every move, shapes that form just out of view... something greater than gremlins calls this world home.` ([The Search Continues - Vaelyn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Search_Continues))
- `The Core that we seek, there's something truly dreadful about it. I know that it may very well be what gets us home, but I can't shake this feeling that we've been thinking about it all wrong. ... I mean that the Core isn't a big battery that runs this world, but rather it and the whole of this world is a massive prison designed to keep something from ever leaving. Think about our geo-scans of Cradle just before the crash- they show it as being composed of hundreds of massive slabs of other worlds, almost like plates of armor. Then you have the Clockworks, the most unnatural thing I've ever seen. An entire world whose sole purpose seems to be stopping anyone from ever reaching its Core.` ([Becoming a Champion - Feron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Becoming_a_Champion))

This follows the idea of the Swarm being a later occurrence, while Cradle was indeed made to shield from the darkness, the Sleeper has told of, and, by the event, covered in the Pact, Cradle became a prison to contain and seal the Swarm near and within the Core by th e act of keeping the Core sealed.

And yet, it is unknown, weather this darkness, the Swarm, and the Void are the same. But, we can to assume those being such, as this creates means for the narrative to be fulfilled, - that the Void is darkness, unless it was an unexpected event. The idea of the Void, or at least the Swarm being this darkness, we believe, stems from the idea of descending into beast's maw, a descend into darkness, while the knights are compared to the light, as stars, whose fire is intended to be kept: `WITHIN MY DREAM I SEE YOUR LEGION FALLING TO THIS WORLD LIKE BURNING STARS. YOU FALL WITH PURPOSE, BURNING EVER BRIGHTER AS YOU REACH FOR THE HEART OF THIS WORLD. HOLD DEARLY THIS FIRE IN YOU, FOR DARKNESS WILL CONSUME ALL THE NIGHT IF ITS STARS BEGIN TO FADE.` (Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace). Here, it is also established that the darkness is yet to come, as stars are fading in the Clockworks, where in Swarm is located. This would not directly mean, that the Void and the Swarm are also the darkness, as Sleeper's metaphors omit much of details in regards to the main actors and dangers - that is darkness is everything endangering Sleeper. But, this would seem fitting, as Sleeper is in the Whitespace, an opposite of darkness by its design.

The madness is followed by betrayal and opening of the Void by supposedly non-malevolent Swarm are connected. What is the reason behind this maddening affliction?

It seems that the Clockworks were completed by the time the king went mad, so something happened after the completion of the Clockworks, but before the Core was sealed and Architect going mad, - something which was not expected by the `mechanical genius`, which had to live through entirety of Clockworks construction, if we take this concept of the king as a living being rather than an ide created by Crimson Order.

This would likely being near same period Tinkinzar had disappeared, as we have discussed on Pakrat speaking of the king as if he saw him: `Tinkinzar not seen for many many years. Crimson Order carries out Tinkinzar's plans for Cradle. Emberlight was blight on master plan because built by outcasts. Haven was probably the same, founded by non-Gremlins` ([Pakrat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pakrat#Dialogue)). With the consideration of the idea of a king being a only a concept, as [previously suggested](#king-tinkinzar), we can assume, that Crimson Order took reigns after king's maddening affliction.

This property of hunger of the void seemingly was inherited by the Swarm as stated: `IT DEVOURED THE KNOWLEDGE OF TIME... MEMORIES OF THE DEAD... THE HEARTS OF KINGS AND THE SOULS OF THEIR PEOPLE... GOOD AND EVIL... IT CONSUMED.` (Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel), as the capacity of the Void is unknown, while the Swarms is perceived by Sleeper as of the greatest danger, yet, different from the original darkness:

- `THIS WORLD WAS CREATED TO PROTECT ME. VULNERABLE IN SLUMBER, WORLDS WERE DRAWN TO SHIELD ME FROM THE DARKNESS.` ([Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory]()).
- `WHAT IT WAS BEFORE IT IS NO MORE. NEITHER BEAST NOR GOD, IT IS A CREATION UNLIKE ALL.` ([Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel]()). We will include it here, as those 2 elements could be the "parents" of its origin, as they are mentioned here.
- `YOU FALL WITH PURPOSE, BURNING EVER BRIGHTER AS YOU REACH FOR THE HEART OF THIS WORLD. HOLD DEARLY THIS FIRE IN YOU, FOR DARKNESS WILL CONSUME ALL THE NIGHT IF ITS STARS BEGIN TO FADE.` ([Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace]()).

Hunger is related to animalistic motif present across Black Kats, as those are also related to the theme of hunger and darkness: `These shadowy beasts hunger for arcane power and raided the Moorcroft Manor Archives' precious collection of magical grimoires` ([Kataclysmic Confrontation](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kataclysmic_Confrontation)). We have covered Black Kats [earlier](). It does seem that the erasure of Kat Tribe by Kataclysm, or their banishment to Underworld, had also affected them in their post-mortem state. They search for Owlite tomes even if reincarnated as battle sprites. We had attributed this to both spirits returning from material realm and Core's metaphysic presence, through which spirit can return literally through reincarnation in battle sprites.

One more particularity of Owlites is the fact that their tome - the Book of Grey Feathers,- was the cause of Kataclysm. We can suggest that the Book is connected to the Nameless Realm as both researched by Owlites. It would be a new discovery, if entities and objects connected to the Nameless Realm can cause a creation of a rift into the Underworld and change physicality of affected entities. Could it be, that the event of opening the void was similar to Kataclysm? If so, why there is no shadow damage in the Swarm-native entities, as they would be affected by it, or by curse from Underworld. The latter, at that, is a different question, but the general possibility of those 2 events being the same in nature can be a potential path the setting could be aiming for.

`IT DEVOURED THE KNOWLEDGE OF TIME... MEMORIES OF THE DEAD... THE HEARTS OF KINGS AND THE SOULS OF THEIR PEOPLE... GOOD AND EVIL... IT CONSUMED.` (Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel)

Swarm's hunger, compared to Black Kats' hunger, is metaphysical, as it transcends matter, given Sleeper's metaphors

- `THE HEARTS OF KINGS AND THE SOULS OF THEIR PEOPLE`

  Other than Almire, there are no kingdoms. The fact that this quote was presented after Shadow Firestorm Citadel, seems as an intentional design choice.

  If we develop further this idea, then the transformation of Lord Vanaduke through curse, as if his heart was consumed, then souls of king's people is, likely, the state they are found - the Legion of Almire of undead, including cursed Carnavons. As all are classified as undead, and the fiery souls are released only by the time Lord Vanaduke is defeated and the Citadel start to crumble due to lack of `an eternal will` to keep it persisting, it can be a potential theme to link both undeath and Swarm.

  The other possibility is the Shadow Firestorm Citadel, which is connected to the Swarm by its presence in the Throne Room and the general location of this Citadel in the Shadow Lairs.

  If so, Darkfire Lord Vanaduke would remain as a single king, whose heart was consumed by a more commonly known curse. The rest of his people - their souls - would be consumed by the fact of curse afflicting them - as Carnavons.

  We should state, that, so far this theme is only taken from the context of Almire.

- `THE KNOWLEDGE OF TIME`

  The knowledge of time could be interpreted as removal of any elements through which a chronology could be reconstructed, which is partially due to nature of Cradle.

  This interpretation can also be applied to Owlites, as those did document everything around them, even a long past kingdom of Almire. So then the fact Kataclysm, stemming seemingly from dual nature of Nameless Realm, which Owlites did stud, may be a symbolic way of saying them being erased.

- `MEMORIES OF THE DEAD`

  Based of the earlier analysis of the metaphysical state Cradle is found, as one where spirits return to material realm, we stopped at 2 potential sources of this change: The Core and Kataclysm.

  We have proposed that the Core had to be that phenomenon, as Kataclysm had to happen before Owlite Academy was incorporated into Cradle, and by nature of Void Souls, within the Core. As other instances of lost souls were connected to the Underworld and those metaphysics, we argued that the Core creates the condition for lost souls, yet consumed by the Swarm, to emerge even in the physical condition of Whitespace, albeit it allows for regular matter to exist, despite its general abstracted, alien design.

  In this interpretation the Swarm has a transcendental nature of Whitespace as a major component, - despite environment of Whitespace, Swarm has the capacity to influence and manipulate Lost Souls, as Void Souls.

  We may consider consumption of memories of the dead as related to Swarm's ability to create void enemies, from of through the consumption of souls. It is often though in folklore and spirituality, that loss of memories was related to a fragmented state of one's soul, so, with consideration of previous motifs, and here with notion of affecting souls, this can be viewed through such lens.

  While existence of Whitespace is one responsible for a shift in metaphysical boundaries, the Swarm, if it is to be one of Whitespace's origins, also has this ability. If the Swarm is not of Whitespace origin, but rather becoming as such in design due to draining Core's energy, then it is nature of the Void which grants this soul-manipulating capability.

- `GOOD AND EVIL`

  As if the hunger of the void extended beyond those concepts, we can suggest it being a metaphor not black and white morality, but total erasure of those concepts from the rest of the world, through their consumption, - the idea similar to nihilism.

  Another way to interpret this quote is rely on the Lovecraftian themes of eldritch entities - by that we mean that for them, concepts of good and evil do not exist. We see this argument as one fitting here, as th Swarm and the entire Herex plot line frames the Swarm and an eldritch entity, albeit an artificial one with a primordial component of the Void.

  This notion is similar to Apocrea, as it is also inspired by Lovecraftian Mythology. As Apocrea exists through souls, we can suggest, that it and th Void are also connected by the fact of capacity to directly interact with souls, as discussed in the [Apocrean Engines](#apocrean-engines) and [analysis of Apocrean Realm](#analysis-of-apocrean-realm).

From this we can gather that either due to influence of the Void, of due to Whitespace, Swarm is capable manipulating souls. Sleeper places the Swarm as onr capable of consuming everything in interpretations described above, while we link those to events of Cradle, which had to happen far before Sleeper was imprisoned. This comes down to a narrative, which we earlier discussed as darkness can be considered anything of the cases above, while the Swarm may represent it metaphorically, or, as souls are introduced, physically.

The physical connection then should stem from a different nature, rather than Underworld, while it was the main reason behind the downfall of most of the civilizations, presence of the Swarm expands it.

An idea of a relation now of for souls and hunger may be found in the themes of Apocrea and Kats:

- `Though you may venture beyond this nexus, you will undoubtedly fall into one of their traps along the way. The Apocrea bend reality, twisting the environment they invade into a trap. In these traps they stalk any life, harvesting their souls for some unimaginable purpose` ([The Obsidian Nexus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Apocrean_Harvester)).
- `These shadowy beasts hunger for arcane power and raided the Moorcroft Manor Archives' precious collection of magical grimoires` ([Kataclysmic Confrontation](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kataclysmic_Confrontation)).

As those two cases also are connected to nature of souls, we have to keep the in mind in case of a different common motif to be found.

The way Sleeper's quotes are interpreted has also ties with the thematic parity of Shadow Lairs' and themes of Echo Stones:

- [Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods) speaks of Swarm as one to possess bestial features, which is similar to how Snarbolax is described: `Be advised that Recon Knights have reported the presence of a terrible beast the likes of which we have not seen before stalking this forest. Known as 'the Snarbolax,' it appears as a shadowy mass of fangs and claws and seems completely immune to our weaponry. Should you encounter it, try and find a means of escape as fast as possible` ([Shadow of the Beast](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadow_of_the_Beast)).
- [Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Royal_Jelly_Palace) speaks of Isorans as aliens falling onto Cradle with purpose, which is similar to how slimes arrived, from whom ice Queen is derived. Other than that, we don't think this has any relation to further engineering performed on slimes, lichens specifically.
- [Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory) speaks of Cradle as gremlin creation after the gremlin facility - Shadow Ironclaw Munitions Factory, - was traversed.
- [Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel) seemingly contains the same motif as one suggested in the context of Great Work in the [symbolic analysis](#alchemical-symbolism-of-shadow-lairs-great-work-and-rebis) of shadow lairs, as it brings conclusion to all of the above elements in fire, as if the Citadel was the fiery crucible.

  In case of Echo Stones it had shown the extent of Swarm's influence through connection to kings - essentially Almire, - and then giving it a name. In case of Maiden's Tear, it a symbolic element of completeness of the spiritual Work manifested as a capacity to traverse Shadow Lairs and eagerness to withstand them as the demonstration of the Swarm's extent of power. And yet, all of those motifs seem to converge in this vague pair of themes of wildness, hunger, and of darkness or shadows, with allusion to chaos.

Considering all of this, it seems to us by the fact that all of those concepts being vaguely connected, that we are missing a core element to this narrative, which would bridge the gap between nature of the Swarm, Void and the rest of existence.

We think it is the space for curse to exit, as it is the only concept which could come close to be tht diverse to be inexplicable if it affected a different physics - an idea we proposed in the end of the intermediate analysis of curse, but, for now, we don't have other arguments for it to be definitively be the component, which had resulted in the Swarm as it is. But, we have to work with what we have, and from this we suggest now for looking into a different part of the narrative.

Opening of the Void still requires a will or an intent, as it was a direct action, one, we believe, to be related to Architect's madness and betrayal. As the most present theme here is of the parity of hunger and darkness, we are to revisit description of shadow damage: `Shadow damage is generally caused by concentrations of negative energy. Attacks that inflict shadow damage include anything from the psychic manipulation of the aforementioned negative energy to physical attacks using weapons forged from dark matter.` ([The Shadow Knows - Hahn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Shadow_Knows)), which is by itself is an assault on the sentience, as, by proxy, dark matter: `A fabled mineral dark and ominous in color said to contain the essences of both chaos and nothingness`. Shadows is also the term Alpha Squad refers to the Swarm: `We are at the end of the line. Pursued by some kind of terrible darkness we are forced into the unknown. As we neared the Core- I don't know how to describe this really... the shadows came alive and began to attack us. Rulen became enveloped in it and by the time Grantz freed him his body was badly burned. He said it felt like both fire and ice` ([Recon Module: Entrance to the Core - Parma](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Recon_Module)) as well as the the term of [Shadows Falling Over Cradle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2011-10-19), but, now we know that those are on the surface distinct entities visually and thematically. This is also a prime example of the large portion of this analysis existing due to unreliability of its many narrators.

We can compare the dual nature of the Void and Whitespace as candidates for Prime Matter, but also, Whitespace as the Nameless Realm and the Void. First it is that chaos both of the alchemical Void and of Nameless Realm exist, - one symbolic and unseen and one physical and confirmed.

Whitespace is related to divinity and seemingly meant to exist on a different plane rather than material realm to to how alien it is, and as it was encapsulated into the artificial Core, as heavenly kingdom did, existing in an air of divine, while paralleling, as we pointed out, the [myth of the Celestial Kingdom](#celestial-kingdom). It seems as if metaphysically Whitespace is the closest thing to a divine realm across of all dimensions of the established cosmology.

Thematic characteristics of Whitespace as divine can be further affirmed by the naming convention of Orbs of Alchemy and Fire Crystals, as Eternal Orbs of Alchemy and Radiant Fire Crystals. At least the latter is related to the accumulation of the energy - heat - by the presence of the Core. Fire Crystals have similar inner glow as orbs of alchemy. Apart from those similarities, heat is present both as an floating essence, a life force of enemies as they leave it metaphorically, or as fire crystals. As with the energy and souls, we suggest, heat is of the same in nature, a form Energy takes form, as it can be collected to crystals under the same principle as [minerals containing energy](#minerals-and-souls-part-1).

In that regard, Nameless Realm in particular is the only other candidate for divinity, as it was discovered and forbidden by Owlites, which had a relation to the heavenly kingdom of valkyries. And yet, it seems as if heavenly kingdom was not in a different realm, at least not in one forbidding existence of regular matter, as its inhabitants were called celestial beings, in similar manner to the celestial attribute of Isorans. So, some definition of a "celestial" does exist. For now we don't know exactly, weather there is Nameless Realm beyond Whitespace, but we know that for deific entities such as Sleeper and Spirit Mother some location physical or metaphysical should exist, and this place is seemingly outside of material realm.

One notable element, relating to heavenly kingdom and its potential inspirations is that [Celestial Kingdom of Taoist](#celestial-kingdom), as while it was divine, it still requires Four Heavenly Kings or Guardians to protect it. Due to this, the Void and Nameless Realm are similar to different perspectives of chaos, while Whitespace if divine and Sleeper, an entity of this real, is still vulnerable, and prior two are meant to represent the opposites, as we initially proposed through a [vertical flow of souls as energy](#the-metaphysical-stack). The symbolic meaning of the Void in parity with hunger, which will be covered soon, also suggests, that it is indeed a location, from which all of matter originates, leaving Nameless Realm ambiguous.

The hunger is an essential element of its duality represented by an organic aspect to an existing mechanical and eternal of Whitespace entities, which are vulnerable to darkness, such as Sleeper. The only darkness capable of existing in many different forms, yet united through the share of dealing shadow damage, is the darkness of Underworld, also present in material realm as curse. Yet, Swarm itself deals normal damage. It can be potentially explained by the alchemical nature of the Void and Nameless Realm as containing all as Prime Matter, that including the curse as it was present in Chaos Clock.

##### The Void: Part 4

`WHAT IT WAS BEFORE IT IS NO MORE. NEITHER BEAST NOR GOD, IT IS A CREATION UNLIKE ALL.` (Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel)

We can interpret it in more distinct manner: the Void is the beast and hunger, and God is the nature of Whitespace as divine. The creation unlike, yet being none of both, in the alchemical interpretation would be what divine Rebis could be - a unity of opposites, and here it seems to be a failed instance, one consumed by the hunger of the void.

An earlier case of Tinkinzar being Red King and Spirit Mother the White Queen could be a symbolic link, as if Tinkinzar was the representation of the material, the Clockworks and everything around the Core, worldly, and Spirit Mother as the divine, one associated with the divinity and themes of nature in the context of Almire.

We assume that the Swarm had taken qualities of the Void, after it was influenced by it. And, it was capable of feeding on Core's energy. If it was of Whitespace origin, it would explain its ability to directly interact with the Whitespace, or, as if Whitespace and the Void were of similar underlying nature.

Essentially, it comes down to the interpretation of the **hunger of the Void**, which was felt by a non-corrupt entity to become the Swarm. It is then the Void which corrupts, if we disregard the curse motif, present until this point in the analysis of metaphysics.

As there are no instances of the Void, we can attempt to connect it to the curse. But, now it has its own themes: it indeed does change physics of affected, cursed, entities [as far as we have discussed](#intermission), but Swarm only has characteristic normal damage, which is a requirement by now for curse to be consistently present. We have explained nature of normal damage as one attained by the alchemical equilibrium by relating to Prime Matter, but, this so far it seems as a logical leap. Could than the curse be still prevalent while chaos of the Void negates it?

Here Chaos Cloak is important, as it includes curse and has its symbolism, - as it is connected to Nameless Realm. It is clear that the Void and Nameless Realm are thematically different but mechanically the same interpretation of the concept of alchemical Prime Matter. And, as Nameless Realm is similar to the Void, we can assume that the curse also "dissolves" in the Void, as both represent this chaos. This can be a feasible interpretation.

More connection can be drawn from the design of locked enemy gates - as mentioned in the [Divine and Whitespace Clockworks](#divine-and-whitespace-clockworks), the enemy gates are marked by deep purple eye, which seems us as point of connection of curse and Whitespace, apart from being foreshadowed in the [promotional art](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:SpiralKnights_News_30.png).

A 2-color quality is found here, as Swarm is characterized by the black and pink - purple in Whitespace, while Whitespace is white, accompanied by gold.

Through this we can bring Swarm's nature, as well as a distinguished nature of the Void to 3 essentials:

- [Whitespace](#divine-and-whitespace-clockworks) represents order, divinity, godhood, and blessing, by proxy of [Spirit Mother](#almire-and-spirit-mother), Sleeper, and contrasts to the Swarm themes. It is light, with colors of white and gold.
- The Void is chaos, hunger, and beast. It is metaphorical darkness, described as shadows, and literal blackness. Through the Swarm, its colors are a lack of them and accent on pink.
- A [color-coded symbolic association to curse](#intermission-analysis-of-curse) as the evil eye looking down. Within this theory, the third essential in the curse, potentially negated by Prime Matter, or the Void. It is the only component so far possessing a color of dark red and purple or pink, and the most ambiguous in its application in the context of Swarms conception.

##### The Void: Part 5

Here, the Void and Nameless Realm are the dual interpretations of Prime Matter and its paradoxical nature, one of darkness and wildness, opposed by the order of Whitespace.

This notion could be similar to the Void in the teachings of Godai, wherein it represents a concept of Heaven, Ether, Space, Center, and Void, which, in consideration of the motif of [Celestial Kingdom](#celestial-kingdom) might be close to the real identity of the Void within Spiral Knights. This idea also is similar to the the concept of voidness in Buddhism, of Sunyata, the ultimate reality, but, as the concepts from alchemy persists, we lean rather to their's interpretation of the Void as the Prime Matter, with an addition of the wild, instinctive, aspect of hunger.

Now for the symbolic element of hunger and void. What we believe to be the foundation for the further work to be done in understanding of the Void and hunger is the ongoing motif of parity of hunger and the Void.

This theme is of the same nature as an established motif, which is found across mythology and folklore - of __paradoxical emptiness of the Void, from which the World was formed__ in the according creation myth, such as _Wu Chi of Taoist_, the _Genesis of Christian Theology_, as _Chaos of Greek mythology_, and _Ginnungagap of Norse mythology_, and as _Sunyata of Buddhism_. This idea was suggested in the context of [rock salt as an alchemical prime](#rock-salt-and-alchemical-primes), possessing similar dual external relation-oriented nature.

Lastly, there is `The daylight, the starlight; all hope is merely waiting for their dark shroud to return this cosmic play to its primordial black` ([Professor Allister Danford](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)) - which [now seems](#apocrean-engines) as if Apocrea, despite its out-of-time existence and position, did emerge from this primordial blackness, very reminiscent of the Void. And, as there are no other such concepts, indeed being it, _merging Lovecraftian, alchemical, and celtic motifs_ - a notion, present across entirety of the timeline.

Due to this, we can make a guess, that the hunger in question, while has this paradoxical relation to the Void, marks the Void as the real origin of the Universe in Spiral Knights. If the Void is the Prime Matter, the Round Chaos, then, Nameless Realm, had to be either Void's name, given by Owlites, or the realm stemming from the Void or coexisting with it. We have suggested, that souls and energy had to come from somewhere, and suggested it to be Nameless Realm prior ot a detailed analysis of the Void.

Then there is existence of dragons, which we so far considered far more ancient species. As with the creation myth, dragons are generally thought of as the most ancient creatures, which fits with our established timeline. Since the dragons of Spiral Knights exist in 3 subspecies, and as we concluded, capable of traversing Underworld and material realm, what makes then incapable of also accessing the supposed divine realm, characterized so far as Nameless Realm and/or Whitespace, mainly to how elemental defense is the one protection in Nameless Realm.

If Whitespace contains Sleeper, and is found within the Core, it would be questionable, how in the first place Whitespace was found or summoned. We could attempt to rely on Owlites, as they are the closest to those concepts, essentially by that making Whitespace same as Nameless Realm, or at least its part in the Core. As with Kats, there is no information on Whitespace's prior existence, while Nameless Realm has most of motifs shared with Whitespace, apart from chaos.

We have previously considered the [creation myth]() as one depicting divinity of dragons. In it, storm dragon was the one closest to a divine dragon, whose passing created sun and mountains, the foundation for the world, as it was explicitly stated to be created, compared to being razed and shaped, as if there was a specific sequence by which dragons' power could create a world.

As far as established concepts go, we can suggest, that creation of the world in this myth could be more literal than initially thought. Weather it is so, Nameless Realm, we propose to be the exact realm wherein the aforementioned deific entities exist. The Whitespace would fit in this framework as an intermediate point of transitioning from material realm into the Nameless Realm by the fact of being contained in the Core so that it had to be summoned in the first place. This would parallel to the idea of opening the Void from material realm. Through the existence of Kataclysm and Grim Gates, we can conclude, that this ability to intersect the realms is part of material realm physics encompassing any realm, including Apocrean Realm. Apocrean Realm in this structure seem to be closer to the Underworld, and, due to its eldritch nature, it might exist on its own, most separate from the rest, but nonetheless connected.

And, as paradoxical nature of the Void and hunger being at the origin of the world, we suggest, that Nameless Realm and Whitespace being this other part of the dual, paradoxical, alchemical nature of the Prime Matter. And, through the themes of divinity we can place more certainly Nameless Realm as one from which, then, energy and souls are derived from, eventually reaching the Void, uniting with it. Within this conception, Apocrean Engines, which run on souls, might be the eldritch interloper within this more traditional cosmology.

<!-- Apocrea specifically represents some interesting motifs:

- [Apocrean harvester](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Apocrean_Harvester) has symbolism of 3 eyes
scarabs have 3 eyes and are associated with the Undead
- Apocrea thematically is associated with Lovecraftian mythos, but the connection, with Scarabs introduced, is deeper:
- Both scarabs and Apocrean harvester resemble insects in their anatomy, or at least, Arthropods
- Presence of 3 eyes must be reinstated, as the only instance of such symbolism we observe at the respawn pads in the Whitespace, apart from being related to a symbol of alchemical silver.
- Back in [Arrival of Undercorp](#arrival-of-undercorp) Snarbolax was pointed out as one with the cursed mane and prior of 3 eyes, it was likely intentional design choice to demonstrate the capacity of the curse in its many forms. -->

##### Resonance, Nature of Whitespace

Resonance is a term used by Herex in his information module in [Hidden Hideout]():

- `The Nine are blind, they cannot see the Truth that lies below. The Nine are deaf, they cannot hear the Resonance that beats within this world. Herex no longer serves as one of the Nine. Only Herex sees and hears the Truth` ([Spark and Roar - Hidden Hideout - Recon Module - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spark_and_Roar/Hidden_Hideout)).
- `Infiltrate the Complex. Take all schematics. The Nine are quite but we will silence them. The Knights persue but we will halt them. Only Herex comprehends the Truth. Only Herex will descend. There can be no other` ([Crimson Chaos - Complex 357 - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Complex_357)).

Comprehension of truth is tied to being located in or near the Core. The truth is equal to hearing the resonance beating. The latter is the organic motif, which was brought up in relation to [Core Terminal's design](). Then we add quote from Echo Stone of Royal Jelly Palace: `YOU FALL WITH PURPOSE, BURNING EVER BRIGHTER AS YOU REACH FOR THE HEART OF THIS WORLD.`

With this we can identify 2 organic motifs within Cradle's nature:

- Of eyes, arms/hands pulling (`ITS MANY EYES CANNOT SEE YOU NOR CAN ITS MANY ARMS REACH YOU`), mouths, hunger and consumptions, - attributed to the Swarm.
- Of Heart, heartbeat, and nerve center, attributed to the Core.

Due to the term of resonance `beating`, we are leaning to identify resonance as the proper Whitespace of the Core and/or Sleeper.

The Core and subsequently, Sleeper, seem to possess lack of significant control outside of the Core, given assistance on the Unknown Passage and [Parma's quote](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Refuge): `Luckily I was able to pull some strings and find you an exit`. So, due to this duality within organic motif, we believe, a common theme emerges, as if in the past, both the Core and whatever the Swarm was - `WHAT IT WAS BEFORE IT IS NO MORE. NEITHER BEAST NOR GOD, IT IS A CREATION UNLIKE ALL.` ([Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel)), __both in design and themes, were meant to exist as one.__

Based on the idea of Crimson Order sealing the Core as an aftereffect of Architect's madness and betrayal, the analogue to being blind and deaf seem to fit by being cut off the truth within the Core. Herex's Truth in that context means following Architect's madness. Which, through the alignment with the Swarm, seem to suggest it being a truth from the perspective of a supposed madness. This idea should be justified, as Herex, by being a trusted member of Crimson Order, had to, originally, be with the rest of the Order in their planning, and stability of the Iron Law.

We believe, here we are observing a parallel to betrayal of the Architect, which would pose a question - weather Herex and Architect were affected by the same mindset? If we immediately bring up older narratives, could it be the case of "poisoned minds" of trojans for them to turn against Isorans?

##### Common Narrative of Curse

As for the Truth which Herex has spoken of. Given his opposite alignment, the truth here seems to be nature of the Swarm within the Core, as far as we can gather information based on Herex's behavior and prior analysis of Sleeper's metaphors.

The only concrete distinction of the Swarm is that it opposes Sleeper and it was brought to existence through a combination of at least 2 essentials - Void and Whitespace.

In that regard, Swarm had to be introduced to the Void though an act of opening the latter by someone in order for the Swarm to feel Void's endless hunger. This, we believe, connects Architect's madness and Swarm's creation.

If we consider, _how Underworld through curse had hijacked each of known civilizations_, we can extrapolate this concept onto the initial advancements of gremlin empire and Swarm being the entity assisting in Clockworks construction gone wrong.

On the other hand it is the Void which is used to clone or mirror void variations of enemies. The Void in that case is thematically similar in nature to curse as both spread the curse by existing.

If we were to introduce aspect of the curse, we would lean to the idea of Swarm being its metaphorical embodiment, as of a failure to achieve something - given:

- Prior alchemical themes
- Curse seemingly empowering the bearer at a cost
- Prior instances of curse as a tool, with Undercorp eventually targeting most valuable elements of said civilizations.

In case of Nameless Realm, Whitespace and the Void we have to consider a myth of divine alchemical Rebis as an end of properly combining opposites of Prime Matter as the primordial Void and divine Nameless Realm, in order to complete the Great Work.

In this alchemical connotation Cradle could be seen as the Great Work in the making, as it was built around slumbering Sleeper, and as of current discussion, when it awakens, it would not be likely vulnerable to currently presented dangers. This interpretation requires for a distinct intent for the initiation of the breakage of the Pact between Architect and Sleeper.

But, since we already have similar narratives, such as _transformation of trojans_, _arrival of Undercorp and their work with Titans_, _reasoning of Margrel_, we can find a potential pattern there. The only more distinct clue so far is the idea of Lord Vanaduke following a myth of power in his eventual arrival to the blackened shrine. The motive of acquiring power for a loosing side is too vague, and due to this, can be applied even when its wrong.

###### Divine Properties of Whitespace

Chaos Cloak grants protection in the Nameless Realm, and is characterized by elemental defense. It also has depiction of an antique evil eye, linking to curse though this design, as well as weakness to curse and all statuses. The [Divine Veil], by nature of divine protects of all unnatural damage - shadow and elemental. Through the analysis of elementals, which [Clockwork facilities do incorporate](#clockworks-and-Magitech), they also can be considered as unnatural, or magic as Spiral Order refers in the [Arcana](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arcana): `An exceptional handgun that fires powerful, elemental shots that many Spiral Knights refer to as 'magic missiles'`.

Compared to the affinity within Nameless Realm, divinity grants protection from curse. We have followed this logic during [intermediate analysis of curse]() - with this, we have gathered, that Nameless Realm incorporates curse as a natural phenomenon.

The [Divine Avenger]() [inverts](#inversion-of-curse) the curse, transforming it to elemental damage, yet with prevalent Dread Seal symbolism. This was covered in the [Inversion of Curse](#inversion-of-curse). This motif, encapsulated by the Avenger may be the exact lead we are searching for, due to to symbolism of gold in relation to divinity and as complementary color in Whitespace.

A similar extrapolation was in the phenomenon of [glowing patterns on the Ancient Grove ruins](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Area-March_of_the_Tortodrones-Ancient_Grove.png), outer carvings of [Tortofists](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Tortofist), and inner surface of [tortoise shields](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Tortoise), glow pattern of [Gran Faut](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gran_Faust) and [Volcanic Plate Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Shield). All of those items relate to Underworld. In case of Ironmight, it was covered in the [Ironmight kingdom](#ironmight-kingdom) and [Volcanic elements](#volcanic-elements).

There are also notions of rage, which seem to tie to more ancient properties of the world, as the [Eye of Fury]() and [Tome of Rage](), as the prior is a never-seen-before crystal, similar to [gold crystal keys of Whitespace](), and the latter bearing ancient symbol of alchemy and the orb of alchemy as a metaphorical gateway, represented by a glowing circle on tome's cover.

One last element we will introduce is the potential [celestial origins of the heavenly kingdom](#the-moon-and-nature-sprites), paralleling an underlying myth of Asgard's creation. This element consists of the idea that somebody before gremlins had to protect Sleeper as it slept. As heavenly kingdom already has this guardian motif, and as they stand at the near beginning of time - we propose them being those guardians of the heavenly realm ,or paradise as it is referred, physically being the Nameless Realm, or rather its borders.

We come to this idea not only through the reasoning behind Sleeper's protection but existence of Whitespace itself as an environments, alien for the material realm. We have to keep in mind that Whitespace appears as such while being enclosed into the Core, and, while allowing for material realm to exist within, given how knight can traverse it.

Due to this we propose a solution, which seems plausible and targets details of Swarms design and purpose.

##### Organic Theme of Swarm and The Core

We propose, that Whitespace is the presence of the Nameless Realm in material realm through containment in the Core. By proxy of Whitespace, Nameless Realm embodies a divine aspect of real-world alchemical Prime Matter while preserving its chaotic nature. It exists as the highest realm within which divine entities exist. The Void present the whole from which creation of known cosmology stems and from which at some point Nameless Realm had to also separate, containing a capacity to contain souls as energy, while the Void became the absence of those.

Before Whitespace being enclosed it was the place Heavenly kingdom of Valkyries had originated, - as heavenly or celestial beings, - and as gods were assisted by giants in construction of Asgard, so Valkyries were assisted by titans, tortomega, in construction of physical heavenly kingdom, which, as Asgard itself was both physical, and located in separate realm.

In the context of Clockworks, pre-corruption Swarm within Whitespace is utilized to assist in Clockworks' construction under Sleeper's will, _as Sleeper is contained and protected within the Core, sleeping, and through dreaming - building and interfacing with the rest of the world_. The interface is this pre-corruption Swarm.

__The motif of arms, eyes, and hunger seems us as interfacing function of the Swarm, when the Core is the heart - by being the energy source, and nerve center, mind, as Sleeper's will.__

By introducing the Void into Whitespace, it would result in unity with the Void:

- On one hand, a unification of opposite interpretations of Prime Matter, a marriage of opposites producing divine Rebis.
- But on the other, the Void is chaotic and unrefined - the first stage of the Great Work. Introduction of impurity most likely would've resulted in such unforeseen, detrimental reaction.

As all is drawn to the Void by following an idea of originating from it. Hunger of the Void is posed as an essential, dangerous element - entropy, - which is implied to embody Swarm's goals of consuming everything while being imbued with a nihilistic motif of consuming both abstract good and evil (`IT DEVOURED THE KNOWLEDGE OF TIME... MEMORIES OF THE DEAD... THE HEARTS OF KINGS AND THE SOULS OF THEIR PEOPLE... GOOD AND EVIL... IT CONSUMED.` - [Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel)).

It seems to us, that most of simple/straight motives falling under destroying/consuming the world, if sufficiently analyzed, would fall to those nihilistic themes, apart from a few exceptions.

Based on the idea of Swarm using power of the Core to expand and grow, we suggest it is the case of its original nature from Whitespace required to be sustained in the devoid of the connection with Whitespace state by the fact of Core being sealed.

###### Symbol of Shadow Lairs' Eye

The originally intended unity of Core's components with one of its essentials being compromised, immobilizing Sleeper within the Core, seems us to parallel _themes of Undercorp targeting or hijacking the weakest elements of prior civilization_:

- For titans that were tortodrones, meant to protect the latter.
- For Owlites, the Book of Grey Feathers and the Academy were the prime center of their researches.
- For pre-Cradle Isorans, Wardens were the main protectors.
- For Almire, Lord Vanaduke was their leader and the Great Citadel, their capital.
- Then, it would be not the power source of the planet for gremlins, but in a theme of defenses, - whatever was the Swarm, a builder, or a protector from the Core, as Sleeper refers to it as entity changed beyond recognition: `WHAT IT WAS BEFORE IT IS NO MORE. NEITHER BEAST NOR GOD, IT IS A CREATION UNLIKE ALL` ([Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel)).

The Void then serves as a reason for Swarm's expansion. This hunger would potentially perpetuate Swarm to utilize all of its capabilities, that of using souls, it order to expand and consume. The hunger, as discussed earlier parallels one of Black Kats, which now seems intentional, as source of both would be close enough.

But, if we to follow this unconscious hunger, then motif of an eye and power to directly manipulate souls seems fitting _only for entities with a will and animated by curse_. Finally, the eye so was always drawn back to nature of curse in its many forms. The manifestation of curse, closest to being depicted through the gremlin infrastructure as the eye of Shadow Lairs on the monitors, is the carvings of an eye on tortodrones' shells. There, they were serving, as we discussed in [tortodrone section of curse](), they serve as means of securing the mineral power source through soul sealing, as in Carnavons, Black Kats, Faust, and Lumbers. Essentially the capacity of sealing of souls or energy through aspects of curse is predominantly Undercorp's method. If Swarm was created through a direct act of Undercorp's involvement, the eye would be rather simply justified as a mark of Undercorp's involvement.

At that, motif of divinity would be likely preserved, if only Void and Whitespace would be united, as it seems natural order of all things. But, we know certainly, that it is the curse, which inverts any divinity, - the prime example for it being [Armor of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Armor_of_the_Fallen), which is related to curse. Here [Crown of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crown_of_the_Fallen) halo would be the most direct representation of any darkness.

##### Themes of the Swarm and Void Monsters

Due to the rest of Swarm's design, apart from its blackness derived from the Void, pink color and eye symbolism we so far have attributed to curse. As both Void and Nameless Realm proper are the foundations of the Universe, curse would be accounted for, and so it would be negated, resulting in a normal damage, while encompassing the rest. It is represented, we believe, by [Swarm turrets]() being of normal damage, while summoned monsters encompass all of the other damage types.

Among its void monsters as well Swarm itself, we identify the following elements:

- Swarm [seed]() has a central element to it - of a rectangular sigil. Once the seed is suppressed enough and no outward glow is present, it becomes a Swarm source-like entity. If we draw parallels with the collapsed grim gates, 100% expanded Swarm seed's core seem to show the important element of its design, which is meant to be seen to the point of being present on the loading screen of Unknown Passage. This symbols seems to be too precise, so, it had to possess meaning, as much as the Shadow Lairs' depths' pink eye is prevalent and associated with the Swarm.
- Void [Lumbers]() have no paper seal and possess a giant axe. The only other axe-wielding lumber is the Ironwood Sentinel. Given latter's naming, we know it is made of ironwood by gremlins, given their activities in this field of research. Those lumbers are seemingly more combat-oriented, than the other lumbers.
- Void [Zombies]() have armor. The only zombies which have it are Slag Walkers and Carnavons - both fallen warriors of the kingdom of Almire.
- Void [Thwackers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Thwacker#Void_Thwacker) are main gremlin enforcers.
- Void [Wolvers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver#Void_Wolver) in design are similar to apparition of a giant wolver and perma-frostifurs, both being extremes of wolvers' transition into supernatural.
- Void [Gels](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lichen#Void_Gel) are not Toxoils, which at least suggests Herex's invention of the latter was a later occurrence, or one not replicated/consumed by the Swarm.

Those combat oriented aspects make us think, apart from gameplay perspective, of the Swarm as initially a highly advanced defense system derived of Whitespace. Capacity to create monsters from the void does not seem as something acquired as the entity was transformed. Even more so, Swarm seed has the peculiar symbol, closely related to the general motif of rectangular patterns, shared with the Whitespace of the Core.

As we now completely operate through patterns and themes, we would make a logical leap and propose, that the Swarm Seed symbol is the representation of what Swarm was, it is a symbol as much as symbol of alchemy is meant to represent entirety of alchemy. The rectangular pattern, as much as the rest of Swarm's design, is meant to be closely associated with the Core, and as a result, the symbol should stand for the essential element of the Core. Here, the pink eye is the sign of curse being manifested in the environment of Whitespace, overtaking the identity, unless it is a case of the eye being integrated later, similar to tortodrones.

The function may be also suggested by the location of the Unknown Passage as gremlin grounds - to initially accompany them. We can gather this based on the color scheme of the tunnels and by the pattern of 2 projectors before the elevator platform.

While the Passage itself is within the skydome, we can potentially explain this by being a containment for the location, as it was seemingly ripped from the larger structure, as we have not seen non-gremlin actors demolishing the tunnels.

Broken bridge between final arena and elevator platform of Unknown Passage and broken bridge of the Core Terminal and the Core hatch seem us indirect actions of Crimson Order under the established Iron Law, - a containment procedure, reminiscent of Gauntlet and Iron Hulk.

##### Pink Lightning: Part 2

Then there is pink color, present in the design of Swarm-native entities and lightning arcs within the skydome of the Unknown Passage. Pink design of prior is similar to presence of gold in Whitespace in respect to its abstracted design, specifically, of a golden crystal used to open the gates.

The lightning is one associated with Clockworks' Power Complexes and exterior of the Core. Based on the fact Swarm feeds off the Core, the lightnings could be of this origin, as literal energy traversing through the body of the Swarm in incorporated in it parts of Clockworks.

The pink lightning in particular is seen in 4 other instances:

- Arkus's Leviathan strike, summoning crystals, which in this context can finally be explained as instant condensation of energy to crystals as we proposed them - minerals - to be.
- Lightning striking the ritual site in Moorcroft Manor prior to summoning Margrel.
- Trojans' charge, which inflicts shock and creates lightnings.
- Lord Vanaduke's arcs of lightning during his cast of Fire Snakes spell. This was not brought up before, but now we see it as a perfect opportunity to discuss.
- Sparks of Life could also be attributed to this phenomenon, despite being different color.
- Usable [Storm Caller](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Caller#Storm_Caller): `A party favor of the gods, used to summon a lightning bolt from the heavens`.
- Usable [Frenzy Caller](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Caller#Frenzy_Caller): `A party favor of the gods, used to summon a flash of frenzy from the heavens`.
- Usable [Rage Caller](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rage_Caller#Rage_Caller): `A party favor of the gods, used to summon a shaft of rage from the heavens`.

    All of Callers describe the lightning striking the ground as one originating from heavens, while relating to the prize boxes of according themes.

The idea, that we believe unites them all, is the folklore interpretation of lightning adapted into the setting, mentioned in relation to [Arkus](#arkus-the-design), - of the divine intervention or a breach of realms.

In the setting of Spiral Knights this would be a sign of a _momentarily established connection with the a higher or lower realm_. In the cases above - with the Underworld, and in case of Sparks and Callers, - with the Nameless Realm.

In case of Arkus, transformed into trojan, his proximity to it increased to a point of him transforming into a fiend. Then, as he, as trojans, has dark matter, which as we concluded being the symptom, rather that the reason for the affliction. And this exact affliction allows for a connection to Underworld's physics and grants immortality through manifestation of curse and channeling of energy seen in the lightnings. This logic was applied to Lord Vanaduke and Darkfire Lord Vanaduke, as in both instances they are cursed by Underworldly powers and were tapping into those. As in trojans the crustal is the source of power, lack of such conduit would potentially result in direct observation of a transfer of power, as a lightning.

##### How Curse had affected Whitespace

The remaining question is how curse had supposedly managed to remain in case of the Swarm, if we earlier established that both Nameless Realm and the Void contain it. We suggest it being the fact that Whitespace is not Nameless Realm proper, and the idea of curse afflicting entity of Whitespace prior to opening the Void should be a reason and intent to open it in a similar manner to Phantoms bearing characteristic curse, while located between Underworld and material realm of [graveyards](#graveyards).

Only after this corruption, Void, as a chaotic entity, was introduced to an already compromised entity, as it was afflicted by curse. The connection to the Underworld here would not be this explicit, as the afflicted entity is of a different realm, where we can give the design a desired vagueness to be less likely to be identified as afflicted by a common curse.

We do not know what curse is supposed to look and feel like in a non-material realm, apart from the first-hand impressions of the Apocrean Realm, its designs, and underworld-native entities, as [greavers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greaver), from which this symbolism of curse had began.

It is then the nature of Swarm which encompasses all of it. As curse was encountered in large amount of shapes, forms, and manifestations, under a specific application it is plausible to manifest unseen earlier phenomenon. Then, as Whitespace is not the Nameless Realm proper, which assumes its weakness towards elements, such as darkness, despite its divine design, it is then susceptible to Underworld's general influence, here being the curse. That would also be the reason for its protection by the heavenly kingdom.

We propose that the Swarm is a union of an entity of Whitespace, driven by a transformative nature of curse, and amplified by the direct contact with the Void.

Through the primordial nature of the Void, the organic motif is incorporated into the divine themes of Whitespace, and manifested as the evil eye with an organic aspect - seen as the Swarm entity found in Dreams and Nightmares, The Path is Revealed.

The last element to this narrative, we are required to look at Architect's madness, as the supposed reason for Swarm's existence.

##### Consoles: Part 4 - Architecture of Early Gremlin Empire

move after analysis of function

Cosoles is places behinf the throne room in a higher-elevation location with 2 entrances on the sides both of Royal Jelly Palace and Firestorm Citadel.

Previously we suggested it to be an inner chamber behind monarch's protection for both Owlite Castle and Great Citadel. But now, given established backgrounds and motifs, we can suggest those consoles serving, primarity for gremlin empire, as spiritually important locations. If we add imperial motifs of modern gremlin civilization, we can draw parallels to the Roman empire. And there, the most probable function of such deisgn as of Consoles, with their deisgn patterns we see those as altars to a figure within the Core, as the closest deity-like entity.

More so, the name of those structure, internally, is knows as the altar, which now, we believe, establishes a potential direction of the identification of their cultural functun atop of their operation logic.

Due to how this architecture differs greatly from modern gremlin designs, we will follow the imperial motif and refer to those technologically advanced designs - the Artifact and the Console, - as of Early Gremlin Empire.

This duality of function symbolic and operational for Consoles seems us close to application of Roman multipurpose temples, for religious, ploitical, and commercial activities.

##### Architect's Madness and Betrayal

Returning to Architect's madness, we will follow with the proposal of king Tinkinzar being the Architect, one to live through existence of Cradle from its conception.

It is here we should finally look at the name of Clockworks. Based on: `VULNERABLE IN SLUMBER, WORLDS WERE DRAWN TO SHIELD ME FROM THE DARKNESS. THIS WORLD HAS BECOME MY PRISON. IN HIS MADNESS, THE ARCHITECT BETRAYED THE PACT. TWISTING HIS CREATION INTO A GAME OF DEATH, IT NOW DEVOURS ALL WHO ENTER ITS IRON EMBRACE.` ([Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory)), we can suggest, that this term is referring to Sleeper's awakening. As Sleeper being asleep was the reason for Clockworks construction, we can assume, based on the name itself, that Clockworks are a world clock, counting until Sleeper's awakening. So, what should follow the awakening? As far as natural order goes, and its position in Whitespace, essentially Nameless Realm, implies a paradigm shift.

Then, there is a Pact, which, considering nature of Sleeper from the perspective of material realm, as a supernatural entity, a deity, would have made a Pact far more significant, maybe even with supernatural properties. This seems as an explanation for the longevity of King Tinkinzar, as one responsible from gremlins' side for the Pact.

while attempting to cross-reference the general structure of this narrative, we found a myth involving the concept of a philosopher-king and deities, which might serve as a basis for the story to be subverted within the story of the Architect.

The following concept is one of more general trope of a king's rule being taken over by a council of multiple figures, due to king's breakdown under an ambiguous, varying across myths and stories, reasons. But one particular example, which by itself serves as the foundation for such narrative, is the aforementioned concept of a philosopher-king, - king Solomon.

- The Architect, supposed to be king Tinkinzar, makes a Pact with an entity known as Sleeper.

  Details of the Pact are vague, but, from our understanding, it has 2 essential elements:

  - Sleeper had to be protected from the darkness in a literal cradle, where it sleeps.
  - In exchange, Sleeper provides means for gremlins to exist, while protecting Sleeper as once heavenly kingdom of Valkyries did.

  Gremlins are to be placed in charge of Cradle's defenses (`Once, the gremlins were in charge of maintaining Cradle's defenses. But they had their own plans` - [Dream and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge)).

  This seems as a beneficial act, as Sleeper would provide resources - as energy, - for initial construction of Clockworks, while gremlins do the work, in the process creating the Great Colony.

  The Sleeper's resource we are referring to is the assistance to gremlins in construction of Clockworks in the form of matter-manipulating, matter-materializing, and potentially last defensive entity, which would become the Swarm, as evident by the ability of Whitespace to manufacture solid matter out of nothing in the events of Unknown Passage, and potential creation of Divine/Whitespace Clockwork tunnels in [A Step Beyond]().

- As all clans serve the Great Colony, and by proxy king Tinkinzar, we can suggest, that gremlin clan structure or at least the stained relation between them was not so prominent, as the rule was initially more stable, yet absolute, than it is found during the present game's events.

  As gremlin clans located in their according stratums, forming the general territory of what could've been considered gremlin empire on across Clockworks, we can draw, that, with the delegation of factories to clans, such as Ironclaw Munitions Factory, the general stability of the civilization would not be of a concern, until a dispute arises.

  Such event, we propose, is the madness and disappearance of the king, and, with no king, reign had to be taken over by Crimson Order.

  Within this more mythological interpretation, the statements as `King Tinkinzar alone upholds the Iron Law!` from the screens at [Engines of War](), would seem as maintenance of the status quo through the Iron Law.

- The madness in question, then, if we are looking for its reason as external, should thematically be related to such entities as Nefarious Imp or Apocrea and how those, as Undercorp, were manipulating fates of past civilizations.

  Considering prior civilizations, - Owlites and Tortomega, - they seem to fall due to scheming of Underworld. In the context of Sleeper, as it is one entity required to be protected from the darkness, we believe, is a hint at the nature of the madness. As it is stated: `Shadow damage is generally caused by concentrations of negative energy. Attacks that inflict shadow damage include anything from the psychic manipulation of the aforementioned negative energy to physical attacks using weapons forged from dark matter` ([The Shadow Knows - Hahn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Shadow_Knows)), which is by itself is an assault on the sentience, as, by proxy, dark matter: `A fabled mineral dark and ominous in color said to contain the essences of both chaos and nothingness`.

  This seems to be a hint to the induced nature of madness, as an overexposure to sources of such influence. Given presence of shadow damage in the rarest instances among gremlins, and presence of devilites within Cradle seems us as another hint towards Undercorp's involvement here.

We are placing Tinkinzar's madness between themes of alchemical Great Work and a hindrance to achieve it through a repeated pattern of civilizations crumbling to Underworld's sabotage through schemed influence in favour of accelerating ascent of eldritch god Apocrea, sustained by energy from the Nameless Realm, coincidentally being the home to benevolent deities.

Swarm's creation is an act of introduction of curse and a narrative of cosmic horror:

- Presence of cosmic horror by its themes suspends the concept of "Truth" in the themes of cosmic incomprehensibility.

  This theme introduces a justified motif of madness within the abstracted cosmic horror story. Based on the eldritch component of the narrative, it is revealing nature of truth as maddening by being a case of [going mad from the revelation](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation). It is embodied by Herex and a later rank missions transition to this theme most recognized by seeming inexplicability of the Swarm.

- The concept of king Tinkinzar, as we have proposed, to be linked to the trope of the trope of the philosopher-king, stemming from the king Solomon. Due to this we proposed an existence of a parallel between Tinkinzar's vision of Clockworks and Solomon's divine inspiration and vision of the First Temple.

  Then it is the quote, - `IN HIS MADNESS, THE ARCHITECT BETRAYED THE PACT` ([Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory)), - which we suggest being here a deconstruction of Solomon's eventual end as God left him, with the full punishment following later, as the kingdom would be divided after Solomon's death. So is the idea of the Great Colony being then ruled over by the Crimson order, which followed after Tinkinzar's madness. The madness here, we suggest, holds the aspect of above motif of cosmic horror story.

- Then, the last component - due to which, mainly, the entire timeline was reconstructed, - the pattern of Underworld's intervention first as a newfound source of power desired within the context of an isolated narrative.

  It is represented by Titans falling to Undercorp, Owlites erased by Kataclysm, Almire falling due to Lord Vanaduke's actions, and several smaller narratives such as trojans, kat tribe, and Snarbolax, - all related to different iterations and manifestations of curse as both literal and metaphorical carrier of Underworld's presence. Then, by addition to each iteration of a greater scope of the narrative than previous - as Titans were set in the woods, as Almire was a kingdom eventually becoming and undead Empire, and as Owlites were set in the setting of the entirety of heavenly kingdom, gremlins are paired with an entire planet, while encompassing all of the prior, - this seems as a distinct narrative if framed in such manner.

  Here a deconstruction of the concept of Underworld is presented through the identified actor, - a corporate entity - Undercorp, and by a more mysterious actor - Nefarious Imp, who we suspected to be related to Underworld's lingering presence on Cradle. Here, we believe, gremlins are fulfilling this role of the repeating pattern, as they are known to work with Undercorp.

With end of civilizations facing with the Underworld and falling, brought into the Clockworks as past histories, with high stakes, it would be fitting for the nature of this narrative's danger be the same, yet drawn to the extremes, as far as the established metaphysics of the fictional Universe would allow without breaking the suspension of disbelief.

With all of those components, we suggest the justification behind introduction of curse to the story of Swarm's creation, as an ultimate failure to uphold the Pact struck with the Sleeper due to Underworld's influence.

The madness aspect then is reinstated by the possible cosmic horror nature of truth/madness as one related to an already eldritch entity apart from alchemical Nameless Realm, that being Apocrea, and potentially channeled or represented through actions of a single entity, such as Nefarious Imp. King Tinkinzar's madness as we have explored it, can stem from earlier actions of working with Undercorp, as the then Crimson Order, if it had full understanding of the events, likely would not work with them.

Both enigmatic nature of Tinkinzar and his seemingly deathless reign up until recent events is not commonly seen so far as a motif. The only entity which could be compared to him would be Nefarious Imp, as it had to outlast titans from their initial beginnings prior to Undercorp's involvement and to the recent events of [Arctic plot](#arctic-plot) and [Maulos](#influences-of-underworld).

##### Common Motif of Dreaming for Sleeper and Apocrea

In the [analysis of Apocrean Realm]() and Apocrea we came to the idea of supernatual nature of Apocrea's dreaming and reality-bending. Then there was analysis of Sleeper, whose metaphoical world, dream, and act of dreaming also have resulted in a concepts, unnatural from the position of an inhabitant of the material realm.

There are Engines `roaring, heard screaming across distant stars. Only souls can fill their void, sublime in its vast emptiness` ([Professor Allister Danford's journal entry](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)), `The Apocrea are ... a terrible legion of otherworldly phantasms whose only ambition seems to be trapping and devouring the souls of all life` ([Obsidian Nexus - Lost Soul](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Obsidian_Nexus)). The souls are trapped and sealed by the Apocrean Sigils and then harvested for the engines.

The engines are seemingly void inside, potentially linking to the ide of the Swarm resultig from an interaction with the Void and obtaining an ability to consume hearts and souls.

The wording of `All of them mere crops against their relentless scythe! Though they may steal sanctuary in the cracks and corners of their terrible realm, it is ever fleeting. The blinding gaze of the Apocrea is boundless` ([Professor Allister Danford](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)) introduced in the context of [the first analysis of the Apocrean Realm](#analysis-of-apocrean-realm) here may also point to the literal Sleeper's Sanctuary, which adds more reasoning to Sleeper's darkness being that of Apocrea.

Then, the dreaming motif.

- `Plucked from the depths of the Apocrean realm, Obsidian Prize boxes are almost certainly guaranteed to not induce madness upon ownership.  ... And opening one will not in any way unleash a terrible, ancient entity from a world of unending, dark dreams into your own` ([Announcement](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)).
- `'Wrap thyself in my embrace and succumb to my infinite love. Let your breath drift from you like candle smoke, dreaming deeper and deeper still'` ([Obsidian Mantle of Devotion](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Mantle_of_Devotion#Obsidian_Mantle_of_Devotion)).
- `Through my eyes you will see the path to ages. Pure is my gaze, free from the lies of reality'` ([Obsidian Mantle of Sight](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Mantle_of_Sight#Obsidian_Mantle_of_Sight)).
- `Within cities where geometry and madness share meaning, constructed from thought, from unnatural impulse, the Apocrea dream dark machines into being. Only souls keep these engines roaring, heard screaming across distant stars. Only souls can fill their void, sublime in its vast emptiness. Oh such beautiful souls! Bright and vibrant like fruit warming on the branch from a summer‚Äôs sun, longing for the pull of the earth below, the chance to seed and grow and birth anew. What terrible naivety! What utter farce! All of them mere crops against their relentless scythe! Though they may steal sanctuary in the cracks and corners of their terrible realm, it is ever fleeting. The blinding gaze of the Apocrea is boundless. The daylight, the starlight; all hope is merely waiting for their dark shroud to return this cosmic play to its primordial black` ([Professor Allister Danford](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)).

In the `... constructed from thought, from unnatural impulse, the Apocrea dream dark machines into being. Only souls keep these engines roaring ...` while we do not have identity of those engines, the fact thay are trough dreaming manifested into reality, and tangible to be fueled by souls, is similar to how Sleeper's dreaming affects the surroundings - the case of manifestation of matter in Whitespace, outsiede of it, and latter creation of divine Clockwork tunnels seems to fulfill the same purpose. We can assume that due to limitless energy those creations are not required in souls, but by proxy of this thinking, we identify both Sleeper and Apocrea as closely related eldritch entities.

Lastly, the rolse of the Void may reemerge here, as there are a few very similar quotes:

- `The daylight, the starlight; all hope is merely waiting for their dark shroud to return this cosmic play to its primordial black` ([Professor Allister Danford](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)).
- `Only souls keep these engines roaring, heard screaming across distant stars. Only souls can fill their void, sublime in its vast emptiness` ([Professor Allister Danford](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)).

In property, both the Void of the Swarm and Apocrea's void or black are primordial, and it are cable of chaotic consumtion of everything in the alchemical interpretation, defined by a lack.

If we consider Void as a fundamnetally neutral but chaotic element of the cosmology, Apocrean Realm, despite its elditch nature and position outside of the rest of cosmology, seems to be both working under the same principles and relating to this concept of the primordial void. Due to this, we assume, that Apocrean Realm itself has to operate through Void, and is the closest to it as much as it is close to material realm, remaining separate from the major part of our metaphysical stack.

#### Undercorp's Plot on Cradle

In case of Cradle, taking in account the alchemical lore and themes discussed so far, we propose, that Herex's goal is to intentionally replicate a state of immortality, achieved before by past civilizations through curse and Underworld.

Underworld is represented through Undercorp and Underworld's figurehead being the Nefarious Imp, while concealing greater presence of Apocrea as most distant from the material realm, but most dangerous, as it attempts to reach the source of souls, located in the Nameless Realm. Here Undercorp performes the same act of granting a wish in a twisted manner, one that eventually advances Underworld's presence, rooted in Apocrea's nature as an energy-driven entity in a realm with no energy to be found.

In case of gremlins, this is achieved through introduction of the Void as a potential tool for achieving the desired state of the gremlin civilization king Tinkinzar had invisioned now in twisted manner, as an immortality and protection not through Sleeper's aid, but of curse and curse-driven tools.

Arrival of Isorans being framed as fated seems to be a continuation of a concluded narrative within the nature of the game as one without a distinct end, but also as a final attempt to symbolically redeem the past events in even greater stakes, as suggested by Sleeper: `WITHIN MY DREAM I SEE YOUR LEGION FALLING TO THIS WORLD LIKE BURNING STARS. YOU FALL WITH PURPOSE, BURNING EVER BRIGHTER AS YOU REACH FOR THE HEART OF THIS WORLD. HOLD DEARLY THIS FIRE IN YOU, FOR DARKNESS WILL CONSUME ALL THE NIGHT IF ITS STARS BEGIN TO FADE.` ([Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Royal_Jelly_Palace)). In this context, presence of Isorans in the past and them being victims of Undercorp on Cradle as the Legion of Ur, seems fitting, as this explanation ties most of loose ends of the story.

Due to those commonalities, we can draw a symbolic relation between Sleeper and Apocrea, as the one between the Void and Nameless Realm, - as concepts representing deities and their realms, close in physical nature, but different in their goals. The goal are defined by irregular and temporal distibution of energy across different realms within the cosmology, its metaphysical stack.

  _"Should You Choose to Accept"_

  {/snippet}
</SubTitleCentered>

In this chapter we will cover entirety of the timeline from the very beginning, starting from the definition of Rebis Theory itself as a guiding principle.

#### Rebis Theory

Rebis theory proposes existence of metaphysics, where _souls, auras, minerals, crystal and mist energy_ are mediums for an omnipresent energy flowing through a metaphysical stack of realms from one most rich in energy to one devoid of it.


The metaphysical stack is identified by quality and quantity of energy in its most abstract form originating from the Nameless Realm, flowing into material realm, Underworld, Blinding Abyss, intercepted by Apocarean Relam, and ending in the Void.

The Void and Nameless Realm are two primordial conceptually opposite realms. Through their presence and influence on Cradle, we have prepopsed an underlying _duality of the energy medium as one derived from aclchemical Prime Matter adn its states_.

According to it, we believe, all supernatural phenomena obversed across Cradle are such energy transfers being performed across multiple aforementioned mediums, existing due to conditions on Cradle as allowing for multiple realms to be connected, amplifying said effects.

Those two realms are the choas of Prime Matter in its primordial state, from which Universe was initially created - identical to and refered as the Void; and the state of Prime Matter in which it is found at the end of the alchemical Great Work, of possessing and internal equilibrium with preservetion of its duality, - the chaos of Nameless Realm.

Nameless Realm and material realm are connected through the Whitespace within the Core, and material realm connects to the Underworld through Graveyards and Owlite Academy by the fact of those being brought into metaphysical proximity of Underworld.

#### `DEPTH 29`

</SubTitleCentered>

- In the beginning exists the Void, from which all matter originates, it is the alchemical round chaos, encompassing all of existence in its potential state.
- When a Universe was created from it, the Void gained hunger, characterized by a lack of its existence as an existing Universe.
- From the Void multiple realms were formed, characterized by the distribution of energy: The Nameless Realm was the first to separate, as it contained all of energy, from which rest of matter would've formed. This is the same energy as one utilized by the Spiral Order. Then material realm, Underworld, Blinding Abyss and Apocrean Realm have followed.
- Nameless Realm is the counterpart to the Void, while it is of the same nature, originally encompassing all of existence, it is represented to be as chaotic as the Void, but lacking an aspect of invading the existence, as it essentially "is", sustained by the energy, compared to the Void, which does not conventionally exist.

    By its nature, Nameless Realm is home of entities, comprised of energy, also later referred to as the celestial beings. Those deities are later to be known at least as the Spirit Mother and Sleeper, constantly residing in this realm.

    The same nature of this dimension is represented by a universal medium of energy. This energy is manifested as souls, subtle bodies, with later attained corporeal bodies in the material realm made of auras, surrounding said souls.

    Souls manifest as consciousness in the material realm, and auras become the energy radiance of those souls beyond physical bodies. The rest of energy, unable to form in larger entities, manifests as Heat, Fire Crystals, and Minerals.

- From souls, sentience and civilizations emerge, the first one being dragons. In the Nameless Realm dragons are the most ancient corporeal species, preceding everything in the Nameless Realm, they encompass 3 fundamental aspects of creation: rage, storms, and frenzy of winds.



- Dragons had their descendants - drakes and wyverns. Form wyverns, griffins evolve, which are to become one of 3 long-lasting civilizations - of Valkyries of heavenly kingdom, also referred as the paradise. Valkyries are the first guardians of the paradise, the Nameless Realm, where Sleeper would reside, being protected.
- The creation myth consists of 3 dragons being slain by celestial beings. Those celestial beings, compared to the deities, are lesser entities, Seraphs and Valkyries.
- By death of those dragons, their respective powers were released, which allowed for the capacity to reshape material realm by demigods known as the Riders. They shaped the metaphorical existence, which came to be the single solar system.
- Dragons of rage flee into the material realm and dragons of frenzy resided in proximity of the Abyss, where Underworld is established.
- The rest of existence has manifested as the material realm, Underworld, and the Blinding Abyss stretching to the metaphysical bottom of the world. Material realm is the closest to the Nameless Realm, with rest following by, except for the Apocrean Realm, which had existed parallel to the Void.


- As from wyverns griffins and subsequently Valkyries evolve, from drakes, terrestrial tortoises have evolved. Tortoises, as griffins, had developed their own civilization, eventually becoming bipedal giant tortoises, the tortomega.

    The paradox of the creation myth leaves vagueness in its interpretation, suggesting that material realm, Underworld and Blinding Abyss all have emerged from the Void, with most of energy present with in the Nameless Realm. As far as this myth allows, it is a statement on the extent of the power dragons wield, which was released in their passing.

- Tortomega homeland is located in the material realm, on a planet in proximity of the place, where a connection to the Nameless Realm would be made.

    It is due to this connection, heavenly kingdom had approached tortomega to build for them a giant floating castle, which would be known conventionally as the heavenly kingdom - a physical home for valkyries on the border of the material realm and Nameless Realm in order to protect Nameless Realm and its deities from the realms, located further from the Nameless Realm, named the Underworld, Blinding Abyss, and Apocrean Realm.


- Existence of Apocrean Realm is sustained through consumption of energy, reaching them only as Souls of the perishing creatures of the material realm.
- Underworld, as one in proximity to Apocrean Realm, is one utilizing souls to a degree in its enclosed culture, separated from the material realm.
- Over time, Underworld develops a soul, or energy-based economy, giving rise to corporations. At the frontier of Underworld and subsequently border on material realm was Undercorp.

    At the hierarchy of its management there are 2 known figures Morgral'm and Nefarious Imp. The latter possess the largest quantity of knowledge regarding the phenomenon of Curse.

- As both realms require Souls, which arrive from material realm as their corporeal bodies perish, this becomes the main reason for both reaching for the source of this energy beyond the material realm.


- Isorans emerge as a distinct civilization imbued with the same celestial energy now in the material realm. They exist separately from heavenly kingdom. There, they encounter rest of dragons, which have possessed powers of rage.
- Underworld is shortly discovered by Isorans, which shaped their own culture and myths.
- By the time Isorans became a spacefaring civilization, they started hunting dragons, primarily for the resources. But, with this power they eventually discovered universal energy, found in dragons passing, eventually developing into an interstellar empire.
- Spiral Order is established.


- Despite Tortomega being ones to build the floating city for Valkyries, they had complex relationship, as both were at a prolonged war in the material realm. During this period of time tortomega would be known as Titans. Due to earlier, greater stability of the relation, castles were decorated with carved statues and busts of titans, reminiscent of their ancestors, dragons.
- In later times, as the war went on, titans were pressed by valkyries back into the woods. In this state, Titans discovered the Underworld.
- By that point Underworld contained a fully developed civilization and, specifically, corporations. One of such corporations would become on the forefront of the Underworld, is the Undercorp.
- As Titans uncovered Underworld, under a lead of the Nefarious Imp, both civilization in beneficial agreement managed to advance at a great pace.
- This introduced shadow graviton technology into the material realm, Underworld's culture - the symbol of an eye, and skillful usage of energy within minerals.
- Through this technology, tortodrones were developed, initially utilizing power of crimsonite - one of 5 minerals containing an aspect of the Nameless Realm closely related to rage, as tortomega themselves were descendants of rage dragons.

    Through further development of graviton technology, Grim Gates were built, though which devilite cities were transported into material realm, built by Undercorp.


- When enough Tortodrones were built, Undercorp had initiated their overtake, betraying Titans by subduing them with the same machinery of tortodrones, originally developed to assist Titans.

    Those tortodrones were modified across dark cities' laboratories with the dark matter, and then transported through the grim gates across targeted locations to initialize the onslaught of titans.

    One of those initial location was later discovered by Spiral Order on Cradle, known as the Ancient Grove, or as referred by Undercorp - the staging area for the assault.

- As Titans are at war with Undercorp, they break all connection with the Underworld through the destruction of Grim Gates. This causes an unaccounted behavior of graviton technology to destabilize.

    While for Undercorp, in the Underworld, it was a series of explosions, improper breakage of the connection on their part had released a curse, native to Underworld from the broken portals into the material realm.

    In case of titans the surrounding area was ridden by curse in uncontrolled manner pouring into the nearby areas of the tortomega homeland - the woods, - afflicting wildlife and forming what would eventually become the Gloaming Wildwoods.

- This curse manifested in the woods as the curse or crimson-colored miasma, transforming a subspecies of a wolver into an entity known as the Snarbolax, granting it immortality through curse, accumulated in its hide.

- Remaining Titans flee in the territories within the homeland, on Cradle this homeland is found in a shattered state after being harvested by the Core - of Aurora Isles, Wolver Dens, and Starlight Cradle.

    In the latter, titans fall into induced deep sleep in order to hide and outlive the erasure of their civilization.

- The remaining tortodrones are left without their masters, they continue to roam across the planet in their in a pattern, reminiscent of tortoise migration. This place where Titans had fallen to slumber will be known as Starlight Cradle.




- Isorans are now a spacefaring civilization with an established Spiral Order. Those spacefaring vessels came before any major colonies were established. One of such vessels falls on planet where tortodrone civilization had perished.
- In this fall, most of technological advancements of Isorans were lost, throwing them back to early medieval age. On this planet, inhabited by valkyries and formerly titans, and surviving an overtake by Underworld, several kingdoms are established.
- It is here Underworld is rediscovered by Isorans. During this period of time a lot of ancient weapons would be created, which, by virtue, carried into the modern times, such as inherited from Titans heavy swords with an amount of inner elemental energy; swords, designed specifically to hunt undead; and gunpowder-powered handguns. Research of undeath and all of those weapons finalized in the establishment of Gunslinger Priests and later Knights of the Rose.
- Over the course of this period of time Spiral Wardens are transformed into the Legion of Ur through actions of a Valkyrian, now only known as the Fallen. With this army and his people, he had attempted to siege the heavenly kingdom from the front, failing.
- Due to those actions he was banished into the Underworld, where he attained fiendish name of Ur while the kingdom itself has distanced itself from the material realm.


- Stranded Isorans develop a medieval civilization, which would eventually become the kingdom of Almire, located near the volcanic mountains; kingdom of Ironmight, which had gained its military power from the ancient homeland of titans - of its unique family of trees; and of northern settlements of raiders.
- The volcanic mountains had contained the portal, through which Legion of Ur had began its conquest of the Underworld, and due to proximity of Almire to those mountains, it is approached by the Spirit Mother herself, granting protection over the kingdom.
- Eventually, Almire is forced to start excavations in the mountains, uncovering volcanic souls and metal imbued with those souls, which was powerful enough to counter and damage equipment made of ironwood and wyrmwood. With this, production of volcanic armor pieces began in the mountains.
- As mountains were ones in proximity to Underworld, its influence rose from its pits - finalizing in a cult of a magma deity, later be known as fire beast Vog.
- The cult constructs a shrine in the mountains, meant for teh second return of Underworld through the means of deceive.
- Such opportunity would present itself, once the Kingdom of Almire was invaded by 2 kingdoms - of kingdom of Ironmight, assisted by raiders from the north. All that time, heavenly kingdom was located above the continent, near the volcanic mountains of Almire.


- The war led to Almire's Fall and Lord Vanaduke leaving into mountains in search for myths, inherited from a time before Legion of Ur would've formed.
- As war went, apart from a cult of a volcanic deity, across graveyards a different cult emerges - of a nameless Vile deity, embodying supernatural poison.
- Events of Almire's Fall, Lord Vanaduke flees into the volcanic mountains. There, he finds blackened shrine of fiendish cult. It curses Lord Vanaduke, transforming him into a fiery fiend and granting immortality.
- Lord Vanaduke returns with the Legion of Ur, annihilates 2 remaining kingdoms and establishes a territory later referred by Spiral Order as the Almirian Empire.
- Valkyries invade Underworld in order to purge it of Legion of Ur. With this, they seal the Legion of Ur in the Underworld, preventing large-scale arrival of Undercorp into material realm.



- A species of divine Kats develops, inhabiting the heavenly kingdom alongside Valkyries and now Owlites, emerging from griffins.
- Owlite named Philoso researches capabilities of curse based on the results of the incursion of Valkyries into the Underworld, and through those means advances heavenly kingdom in far greater understanding of metaphysics.

    Philoso manages to invert the curse, causing it to be weaponized against fiends of the Underworld and of undead.

    Moreover, Philoso discovers the Nameless Realm proper, whose chaotic nature proves to be extremely dangerous, but also reactive to the presence of realms close to the Void - the Underworld.

- At that point in time, Sleeper is till under protection of heavenly kingdom.
- Undercorp, led by Nefarious Imp, contacts divine kat Margrel, which establishes an opposed Kat Tribe. This is the third time Undercorp attempts to enter material realm through such means.
- Kat Tribe works in secrecy, establishing sleeper agents across the kingdom. Once Kat Tribe is prepared, they invade heavenly kingdom with the goal of reaching Owlite Academy of Magics, and capturing the Book of grey Feathers in its most secure tower.
- Through ill-usage of the tome located there, an event labelled the Kataclysm happens, causing first large-scale metaphysical shift, which pulls the Academy and Graveyards of Almire into close proximity of Underworld, making the darkness of Underworld creep from those locations.

    The darkness in question eventually leads back to Apocrean Realm. Through the means of this darkness and metaphysics of lower realms, far greater degree of danger is presented to deities of Nameless Realm.

- Heavenly kingdom is not erased instantaneously, but is overwhelmed by presence of undeath, which forces it to actively combat it.
- In time, heavenly kingdom falls, with no means to protect heavens the planet remains as is, but relatively secure, as Undercorp also has no means of entering material realm as far as possibilities of entrance allow.


- This state of affairs lasts for a long time, until the planet was found by gremlin interstellar empire.
- Here the first contact of Sleeper with the gremlin King Tinkinzar is established. Sleeper reveals itself as a a primordial entity, unprotected by heavenly kingdom, yet capable of beneficial actions, proposing a place for gremlin empire to exists, while providing divine protection.
- Sleeper shows Tinkinzar a grand vision of what will eventually become Cradle, devised to be a new colony, a Great Colony and home for gremlins, as they protect Sleeper. As for the Sleeper this decision to harvest the planet and turn it into a fortress is the measure it is willing to go in order to protect itself.


- Clockworks, comprising Cradle, are built, utilizing both knowledge of elemental magic as well as more natural sciences.

    Most of power generation, construction and smelting facilities tap into elemental and further magical aspects of nature, utilizing soul-based power to the extremes, required for a planet-sized fortress to operate indefinitely.
- The gremlin defenses are contructed - anti-aircraft artillery, which was using shadow damage, in order to prevent any other than Underworld entity approaching.
- The Clockworks themselves then are built as a maze, designed to hinder approach to the most protected location being the Core. The moveemnt of the gates, depths, and skydomes is predictable and is regulated.

    Most of planetsry mass is either smelted in the blast furnaces or is repurposed to hinder and secure access to the Core.

- Core performs as the metaphorical heart and mind of Cradle, manufacturing or mirroring matter from energy. Those include Clockwork Tunnels, as well as an iteration of heavenly kingdom as divine-themed Clockwork tunnels within the volume of Core, ending in the Sanctuary - a skydome, constructed in the same theme of divine Clockwork tunnels.
- To assist construction of Clockworks, an artificial entity, derived of the energy-based nature of Nameless realm is brought into the material realm within Clockwork stratums. In parity with the Core, a far greater pace of construction is achieved, as matter is created from the Core - up to ready to be placed Clockwork tunnels. As those are produced, tunnels are distributed across Clockworks proper by the entity.

    This initial force from Whitespace would eventually become known as the Swarm.
- Finally, Arifact Consoles were constructed as the final measure of defense in case of all of Clockworks would fall. It would be accessed by a series of consoles, which would require a specific key - an ancient generator, to operate.

  Ironically, those consoles were placed at the hearts of previously fallen civilizations to the same threat as now.

- The Core, compared to all of previous iterations of the measures taken to protect the realm, was also used as a power source, delivering energy through a realm, which in the past was at the borders of material realm and Nameless realm, the remains of the original heavenly kingdom. The space at the borders was then named the Whitespace, allowing for creatures of material realm to traverse it.

    In the practical infinity of Whitespace the Sanctuary is established as the closest term to a physical location of Sleeper, protected into a skydome, as mny other locations across Clockworks.

- Once Cradle was build, and as energy of the Whitespace started to power Clockworks, the second metaphysical shift has happened, disallowing spirits to leave material realm, forcing them back from he Underworld in order to slow the spread of Underworld's darkness.

    As fallen civilization persisted, such as eternally shrouded by curse Almire and Owlites, gremlins had to contain those within within skydomes or specifically engineered pathways of gates.

- The king reunites all warring gremlin clans, giving the most prosperous time for the empire, located in the Great Colony.
- A meteor, containing slime family of monsters, crash lands in Aurora Isles, from which it spreads across Clockworks. Apart from being a hindrance, they biology proved to be useful in Cradle's heavy industry, as they ae used as living batteries, bioweapons and heating elements. As more of Cradle's past was reused to construct Clockworks, trees, used by Ironmight kingdom, are mass-produced as it provides one of resources to hold Clockworks together - metals. As kingdom of Ironmight, ironwood and wyrmwood is used everywhere - from structural engineering, to construction and military, providing near impenetrable shielding on par with shadow steel of Underworld.


- Across Isoran colonies a war erupts, leading to a prolonged conflict, known as the Morai Wars. This war leaves most of the civilization in ruins. Morai create a celestial vortex to annihilate Isoran sun. This causes all parties to search an unprecedented energy source.
- Morai vessel in their search for energy, stumbles onto Cradle and is shot down by its defenses. Morai crew is  brought back to undeath under Core's influence, forbidding proper departure of souls. As the Citadel, and as undead, they are contained by gremlins.


- It is due to Undercorp reemerging, as gremlins were researching shadow damage - an uncommon type of damage. As in previous times, undercorp did provide great advancements to Cradle, with soul-sensing enemy gates and graviton-derived electron technology. Undercorp works in the dark, preparing to overthrow King Tinkinzar's reign.
- Through those means, as trojans were tricked into corruption, the king is affected by the curse and subsequent madness, which forces him to allow the entity, responsible for the construction of the Clockworks to be cursed.

    As the curse was essentially applied to an entity of pure energy of Whitespace, it had quickly influenced the state of Cradle.

- This transformation and introduction of curse had not introduced the curse proper, but due to nature of the entity, as one encompassing the curse, it was negated. Despite this, the entity was, as trojans, influenced by the chaotic will from Underworld, allowing for Undercorp to enter properly. Through those action, an opening of the portal to the Void within Whitespace of the Core of all places was performed.

    Introduction of the Void to driven by cursed will entity of Nameless Realm, truncated through Whitespace has resulted in creation of the Swarm.

- As king was succumbing to madness, an Order of 9 members, the Crimson Order, was founded to uphold king's reign. Under the reign of Crimson Order Iron Law is established as a measure of containing the failing state as well as the Swarm at a cost of sealing the Core, which had Sleeper impisoned within its confinements and the source of the Void in possession of near limitless power of the Nameless Realm.
- The Core is sealed, passgaes to the Core are blown off and sealed.

    Core Terminal's passage is destroyed. The other entrance was far more damaged during its containment in a skydome - that being of Unknown Passage, but with elevator to the Core remaining functional, albeit with a broken bridge from the rest of the passage.

- The Artifact, used to power the consoles, is hidden by Crimson Order in an unknwon location.
- While the Core is sealed, the Swarm, hidden within the core, "mirrors" or duplicates itself indefinitely in the same manner as Clockworks were once mirrored or "dreamt up" by the Sleeper during Cradle's construction.
- Despite those actions, a significant part of the Swarm had remained in an area labelled later by Spiral Order as the Shadow Lairs. In its deepest part, one closest to the other entrance into the Core - the area surrounding containment skydome of the Unknown Passgae, Swarm breaches it from the outside while using this breached entrance, as a method of sustaining itself.



- Crimson Order member Herex is influenced by the same madness as one afflicting king Tinkinzar, causing him to seek hidden Artifact in his alignment with the Swarm.
- Another Isoran vessel - Skylark, discovers Cradle. Cradle's likely automatic defenses, as they are not controlled by gremlins at this point in time, strike Skylark down, causing it to crash land on Cradle's surface near the chasm south of Haven. This, finally, leads to the events of the game.
- Alpha Squad begins a descend, over time reaching the Firestorm Citadel.
- Artifact is discovered by Herex and applied to the to the console in Owlite ruins, now ruled by the Jelly King.
- The moment the Console in the Royal Jelly Palace is activated, both Swarm senses it and approaches the Core, as well as Alpha Squad reaches the Core Terminal, entrance to the Core.

    It is due to this turn of events, the Core had opened for a moment, exactly by the time Alpha Squad reached the Core Terminal, and as, subsequently, Swarm felt Core openning, approaching its entrance.
- Remaining members of the Alpha Squad settle in the Sanctuary skydome of Sleeper, in the location of Refuge.
- The Royal Helly Palace comsole is broken by Herex, as he retrives the Artifact. It is brought into the derelict power complex facility below Rescue Camp near Haven. Razwog is tasked with recharging the Artifact.
- Spiral Order-issued battle sprites are transformed into images of the past civilization by the Core through same power of mirroring as it manifested Clockworks from Whitespace.

    For all sprites, to fully manifest their powers, [catalysts](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ultimate_Evo_Catalyst#Evo_Catalyst) are used, as they contain far greater amount of energy, while being contained within same mechanism in design and principle as Whiteapce itself.
- Skylark crew retrives vessel's secondary generator, moving it to Strangers' Haven Lab, establishing there prime research facility with most of retrieved artifacts/boss trophies nearby a reinforced bunker, repurposed as the Spiral HQ command and a Guild Hall.
- The knigth is tasked with retrieving the Artifact in the events of the [Ancient Generator]() and [Crossing the Chasm]().
- Compound 42 and Slime Generators are established by Herex at depths near entrance to Shadow Lairs.

- As Spiral Order reaches the Core, Apocrean realm itself makes appearance, manifestig directly in Haven's Town Square, paralleling the Void being openned within the Core.
- As more progress is made to the Core, Undercorp becomes involved by attempting bringing back Legion of Ur, reactivating Tortodrones, reenacting events of the erasure of Titans through the spread of cursed miasma, summoning of Black Kats.
- Event of Heart of Ice happen, as more of Underworld is brought into Cradel.
- As Firestorm Citadel is purged, and even Spirit Mother starts to influence the state of the kingdom, Undercorp influnces Swarm to act, by reaching for lower depth of Clockworks, leading up to the events of [It Came From Below]().
- Herex infiltrates one of his own facilities - Complex 357, - with his "inner fold" after the burning of Compoud 42, in order to retrive the Schematics.
- In attempt to replicate the conditions of the Firestorm Citadel as inaccessible by gremlins in modern times, Warmaster Seerus after the events of Operation Crimson Hammer - of Spiral Order acquiring Grand Arsenal, - forces Ironclaw Munitions Factory to be modified with extreme application of elemental fire of Flame Souls, resulting in Red Roarmulus Twins.
- Herex recharges the Artifact, causing events of [Shadowplay]().
- As the Knight reaches the Citadel, Herex activates the console in the Throne Room of Firestorm Citadel, starting the process of openning the Core while surging the Firestorm Citadel, leading to the events of [Dreams and Nightmares]().

- Through the means of locked in the console Artifact, Firestorm Citadel reignites. Undercorp make one of larger moves, by creating the conditions seen in the Shadow Lairs.
- Cursed Miasma is reintroduced into the Gloaming Wildwoods as aftereffect of sabotaged launches of corrupted tortodrones during their earlier migrations, but now activity nearby the Core allows greater connection with the Underworld over Grim Gates.
- Based on the unaccounted events of Maulos's cult within Amu-Sol, they create Ice Queen, which reclaims the Royal Jelly Palace.
- Undercorp brings back Lord Vanaduke's soul, lingering in his cursed finery and mask at that point being stored in Spral HQ, into a new armor forged of shadow steel in the Underworld. As now curse is required to tether already left souls to bodies in material realm, curse is applied through the means of Dread Seals onto entirety of the Citadel, resulting in creation of Darkfire Lord Vanaduke and Shadow Firestorm Citadel.
- All of the above locations are pulled in proximity of the Unknown Passage, including the Ironclaw Munitions Factory and Firestorm Citadel.

    Respective consoles of the Royal Jelly Palace and the Firestorm Citadel are removed from the ruins, now being used solely to secure access to the Core, as their elevators are rerouted to the Unknown Passage. The Unknwon Passage, due to Core now remaining open, contains an open, earlier breached entrance to the Core.

#### Rebis Theory: The End

Now within this alchemical mythology-based framework, prime parties are presented: of deities - Sleeper and Spirit Mother; dragons, as most ancient creatures; devilites and their gods of Underworld, associated with elements; and eldritch god Apocrea.

Then, within material realm, specifically on Cradle, isolated histories of Tortomega/Titans, Owlites, gremlins, and Isorans are placed. Those develop precisely due to Cradle and a planet before it housing an entrance to Nameless Realm since heavenly kingdom of Valkyries, the latter being far descendants of dragons and guardians of the entrance.

Here, the method deities of Nameless Relam had used to protect themselves from Underworld and Apocrean Realm was through assingment of a civilization as guardians of their realm. Those guardians would protect an entrance into the Nameless Realm from the material realm - this proposed entrance, we believe, is the Whitespace within the Core, or, in the past, the paradise within the heavenly kingdom.

While the ends of this deed are understood, the means are, we propose, that of the guardian civilization being granted a supernatural or divine benedicton for physical and material needs. From the perspictive of civilization of guardians, this development is undestood through a myth of a completion of alchemical Great Work, a less metaphorical, but metaphysical state of comsic completeness fitting with alchemical motifs of transmutation.

This endgoal of Great Work is an overarching narrative found across the timeline in 3 intances, being the kingdom of heavenly kingdom of Valkyries, kingdom of Almire, and Great Colony of gremlin empire. In all of those examples we refer to those kingdoms at their prime. Due to recent events involving creation of the Swarm and later rank missions' narrative revolving around Sleeper and themes of guardsmanship, we believe, Isorans of Cradle are to become the next civilization of divine guardians.

In this paradigm a repeated pattern of Underworld, as Undercorp, as well as farther Apocrean Realm intervening, as ecosystems existing in transfer of energy and relying on it in far greater degree than inhabitants of the material realm, - present an existential danger to deities of Nameless Realm due to nature of the prior.

Throughout this history including more recent events of Spiral Order on Cradle, Sleeper was slumbering, - requiring aforementioned protection. Through this reasoning we have proposed, that Clockworks are the clock, which measures a time until Sleeper's metaphysical awakening.

The protection was a part of an agreement, which would create an environment for Great Work to be achievable. In case of valkyries it was the heavenly kingdom and paradise, for Almire it was the kingdom itself guided by Spirit Mother in its initial state, and for gremlins it was the Great Colony. The Core, then, is only the latest and largest iteration of the measures, taken by the guardians to protect Nameless Realm.

Those kingdoms are erased by actions of Underworld, with each following iteration being far more damning for its citizens, starting from a few kingdoms taken out with the kingdom of Almire, then entirety of Valkyries and Owlites as only guardians of what would become Whitespace, and now entire planet, populated by gremlins and other civilizations, by proxy of the scale also damning the rest of material realm, if we consider worst-case scnario of interpreting Sleeper's metaphors.

Here, greatest failure to achieve this state of alchemical perfection is manifested as the Swarm, representing a failed unity of opposites: Nameless Realm, proxied by Whitespace, and the Void. Both are tether in a state, reminicent of the proper duality of alchemical Rebis, a divine embodyment of the unity of opposites, derived from the Prime Matter. The Swarm becomes not only a flawed union of opposites, but a corrupted one due to introduction of Underworld-native Curse through actions of Undercorp. While curse introduces entropy and eternal existence, under our proposition, it is essential for Swarm's stability, as an antithesis to a proper everlasting unity based on its studied effects within the material realm.

Lastly, totality of stories on Cradle is disguised as postmodern collection of unrelated narratvives, explored through an idea of all being loosely connected by bringing them together within unnatural proximity of each other. Then, Rebis theory proposes an explanation for those stories, justifying their existence and placement through a common thought framework. This overarching theme presents in-Universe means and ends for the motives of individual characters which operate within this set of physical laws, while exploring its plausible limits.

This larger context of now fully interconnected and causally justified stories is placed within a archetypical story of oppositing forces of good and evil in their many iterations and interpretations, from more classical to postmodern ones.

### _Final Chapter_ Narrative Essentials to Achieving Thematic Consistency

If we omit details of Rebis theory, and use strictly its established general themes as a guidelines for identifying the themes and narratives, what would we get?

We will propose our list of essential elements, which make up the identity of the setting.

First, a distinction must be made between themes of Spiral Order, found only in the intro cinematic, and the rest of Cradle. Here we will discuss elements essential to setting of Cradle itself, as no other location is visited outside of context of Cradle in the base game.

Then there is a distinction between the adventure-friedndly narrative of the game, contrasting the reality of Clockworks. We will return to it later.

- A soft science fiction setting with utilitarian soft magic system, Magitech, represented primarily through modernized alchemical motifs.

  - _Soft science fiction setting:_ Seen in the phenomenon of Clockworks and base concepts of technology found both in relation to Spiral Order, gremlins. Presence of other alien species, such as slimes, without their context as a kingdom, also is important.
  - _Utilutarian soft magic system:_ Most of magic phenomena are written off to the properties or elemental aspects of transmuted items, which themselves are acquired through alchemy. Alchemy, as a tool, is a mundane occurance.
  - _Magitech:_ Most of equipment is obtained through recipes, presented to alchemy stations, with placement of alchemy orbs - this is the foundation for the Magitech element. The gear is then made of not purposed materials, but ones found during exploration. Those materials always vary from mundane for magical.

- An artificial planet, a megastructure, containing generic late-medieval lost kingdoms.

    Cradle's cosmic uniqueness in every aspect is represented through a point of convergence of different genres, motifs, time periods, and metaphysics due to nature of contents of the megastructure.

    Both this setting, and alchemy as a magic/crafting system, create a [purposed "kitchen sink" of narratives](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew), embodied here distinctly by a concept of [Schizo Tech](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech).

But, those 2 generlized aspects would not work without a preestablished genre, which would give distinct themes to both. This element we believe, is a tightly integrated parity of narratives, to layers of megastructure, and to progression through the story.

Both unconnected, diverse narratives from megastructure and setting's design possess a post-modern aspect:

- Stories are mostly self-contained, even when separated from the designs of the setting of a rank mission progression. In this context, Cradle is a tool to explore each story and justify their presence.
- The setting of Cradle, when separated from prior stories is poitioned in a sliding scale of steampunk to dieselpunk. We belive, it is the prime reason for the rest of elements to work as they are, which here is encapsulated into the punk-settings of the two.

#### Tone Shift and the Monomyth

This idea of a change in pace of narration, feel and impression of the late story, and general tone shift towards more seriousness can be observed both through the events of resque camp/introductory part of the game and entire progression up to the endgame in Shadow Lairs.

Resque camp is a more concise example, as it is shorter. It cotains an ending in the form of arrival to Haven. We will look at it from the perspective of a simplified Hero's Journey:

- "Call to Adventure": arrival to the surface of Cradle. While this place is an unknwon planet, the tutorial aspect frames it in a more friedly manner, placing it before the threshold into the unknown.
- "Aid": Encounter of a higher rank mentor being the aid, an assistance
- "Threshold guardian": Confrontation being Ironwood Sentinel
- "Threshold": Arrival to Reque Camp.
- "Challenges": prior to plunging into the abyss are the recovery of the artifact and powering of the Camp
- "Death": Is encountered during an expedition to Haven - Crossing the Chasm, which is framed as a dangerous expedition - as the Artifcat had to be given up to Razwog, followed by burning of the facility
- "Transformation": Traversal of the burning facility
- "Rebirth": Defeat of Razwog in the hands of the Knight
- "Atonement": Encounter of Feron and ascent from the facility
- "Return": Arrival to Haven. We consider it part of the known world due to presence of the Spiral Order their, essentially being the safest location.

In relation to the entire roster of rank missions, its later part, specifically from the Firestorm Citadel and further has a significant tone shift from more exploratory, to more consistent with general plot of more interconnected missions, apart from the intermission taking place between [King of Ashes]() and [Shadowplay]().

The aforementioned [tone shift](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier) is larger setting, framed as Hero's Journey is more lasting and distinct, than the events, followed by the [Ancient Gneerator]().

To further identify this change, we will refer to setting themes, as scenery, and plots. Under a sliding scale of idealism-cynism or grit of the setting, steampunk is first found in realtion to Haven, and following into a more cynical end of second part of rank missios of dieselpunk general, embodies by deeper stratums of Clockworks and theming of the missiosn rhich take place there.

Light-heartedness of a narrative seems justified on the literal planet surface and earlier rank missions, embodied by the town of haven and Strangers, corresponding to darker themes of deeper Clockworks and an endgame, creating an __essential element of duality__.

In case of Cradle, as it is the primary setting, the _thematic shift is directed from the surface to the Core_.

Steampunk elements are charaterized by general Clockworks' design and name of large moving, exposed structures of skydomes and Clockwork Tunnel backgrounds of plant's mass being interlaced with pillars of Clockwoks. But, mostly functional designs of Clockworks' grime and grittyness of the inner locations seems far closer to dieselpunk, leaving less place for the notion, where steampunk often is paired with more idealistic themes. As dieselpunk is rooted in a time revolving around instability and war, it ties with grounded elements of Clockworks and militaristic, imperial motifs of gremlins, resulting in a more cynical narrative.

This does not explicitly mean, that every aspect of the setting should inherit those themes, and here we believe it is the case, as other designs in the form of non-Clockworks' locations contrast this: from floating islands of Aurora Isles and Starlight Cradle, to forests and fantasy fallen kingdoms of Gloaming Wildwoods, Kingdom of Almire, and remnants of Owlite civilization. All of those regions exist, while Clockworks remain both in the metaphotical and literal background, enveloping those structures and narratives.

The look and feel, themes of the game, its adventure-friendly artstyle, design and framing, its inherent need defined by the medium to be fun, assumes that travesing and exploring Clockworks should be a fun and enjoyable activity. It creates a contrast to the in-game descriptions and characters' impressions of Clockworks. This property encompasses much of the game's feel, and its design as an MMO further contribues to it, as impression of the setting differs drastically depending on the method the game is approached: as a "solo" experience, or all missions/the Arcade are completed in a team of 4.

As it is a topic of greater game design, art directon, and fandoms, we believe there is a specific pattern, identified in most distinct manner due to the historical preservation of source material, reamining undisturbed. While this pattern in not strictly identified here, a following quote by Discord user Archaic queries this concept particularly concise: `How much of SK [Spiral Knights] actually defines SK [Spiral Knights] and how much it just reflects the players?`

The format, target audience, and artstyle of the game results in seemingly intended dilution of the in-Universe perception of Clockworks by its characters, as an inherently dangerous place. And yet, this distinction further attributes to the percieved feel of the game. This perception becomes the foundation, in simple terms, of a greater feedback loop, which creates a space between canon and headcanon. But, the latter is eventually rooted in the foundations of the prior, - both in percieved themes and narrative of the story.

In this duality of the story and its directly percieved story and gameplay elements, we believe, the setting of Spiral Knight thrives.

#### Tropes

In order to broadly encompass entirety of Cradle, we will operate in terms of tropes established at the [TV Tropes page for Spiral Knights](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiralKnights) and general principles when referencing TV Tropes, as a catalog of materials of storytelling patterns and devices.

Aforementioned dieselpunk does not forbid steampunk elements, but serves as an umberlla term for specific areas of the setting as in the example of gremlins. As steampunk and clockpunk are usually set in more idealistic setting, their application varies depending on specific elements and goals.

Clockworks' scale and grimy interior presumes dieselpunk. By being explicitly meachnical, clock-like design it is technically clockpunk, which does not extend beyond general application of gears in designs, but, its narratively unwelcoming aesthetic offsets it closer to the cynical end of the spectrum.

Other aspects, briefly mentioned in contrast to Clockworks proper, are the contents of skydomes. They offer a change from prior themes.

- Alchemy is a common tool for production of goods, and accult symbolism stems from iconography and languages of "The Key of Solomon the King", fitting well with its application by Underworld and Apocrea.
- [Sufficiently analyzed magic](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAnalyzedMagic) is implicitly present, since Spiral Order did distribute mass-produced equipment acquired from alchemy, suggesting the "magic" materials have distinct and identified properties. As one of more analyzed cases here can be everfrost, as its application was seen by devilites, expanding its narrative.
- The megastructure is maintained by a civilization of builders, whose archetype is most reminiscent of fantasy [goblins](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGoblinsAreDifferent) with an accent on militarism.
- The initial state - the trope of [Ghibli Hills](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhibliHills) of Haven with Strangers, planet's surface in general, plus Clockwork Terminal except for the Core is one of contrasting elements and a representaion of steampunk-adjacent elements.
- [Dungeonpunk]() of Scarlet Forteress, and Royal Jelly Palace. In proximity of it, [Dark Fantasy](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkFantasy) of Candlestick Keep and [Grave Clouded](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GraveClouds) Graveyards.
- [Uberwald]() of Gloaming Wildwoods if Tortodrones and ruins are considered, otherwise it is [Wild Wilderness](). Tortodrones are the case of [Awakening The Sleeping Giant](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwakeningTheSleepingGiant).
- [City of the Damned](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityOfTheDamned) of Dark Cities. A [Vice City](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViceCity) if not devilites' presence. Due to presence of dark matter, can be considered [Graffiti Town](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GraffitiTown).
- [Dieselpunk]() of deconstruction zones.
- The Core and its [terminal]() has several tropes:

  - Red [omnious clouds](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousClouds)
  - [Dug Too Deep](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DugTooDeep) which is [Delved Too Deep](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Delved_Too_Deep)
  - [Leaking Can Of Evil](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeakingCanOfEvil) due to Swarm's presence.
- [Tone shift](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToneShift) from the surface to the core is a case of [Ascended Fridge Horror](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFridgeHorror). Given Swarm's nature as [eldritch horror](), it is also a case of [Cerebus Syndrome](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome) in the missions after [The king of Ashes](). No acknowledgement of the Swarm prior to [Dream and Nightmares]() makes it more disjointed (likely not by design), and as result, alienating.
- In the system of classic elements of water/fire/earth/air a fifth element is unconventianal, usually iteration/variation of the ether/void, while contrasting the rest. In case of Spiral Knight, there are status effects and the curse. Normal damage also falls to this, as it was the starting damage, but also one of the endgame, due to focus on the Swarm.
- Undeath is prevalent and common.
- Reality can be bent is exclusive cases by eldritch gods and is characterized by different dimensions. Case of Unknown Passage as a  change from standard route in the context of [It Came from Below]() and Nexus with Shrouded Plateau of Shroud of Apocrea. Also manifestation of Apocrean Realm in Haven's Town Square seem to faal to this.
- Presence of eldritch gods, Swarm (technically and Elrtich Abomination), Sleeper (subverted, a benevolent deity), Apocrea.
- Occultism is always linked to Underworldly/hellish nature.
- Underworld/Hell is a [corporation](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilInc).
- The laws of megastructure and the setting impose [elemental rock-paper-scisors]() while expanding meaning of those elements:
  - The newly discovered shadow damage as more than physic manipulation;
  - Elemental damage as proper magic;
  - Piercing damage also being "holy" damage.
- Main narrative is driven by an acknowledgement of a lack or a need in energy. The megastructure, on the contrary, contains no limits in energy, affirming its unique cosmic and metaphysical position in the comsology of Spiral Order, as player character has this perspective.
- The civilization of builders is past their prime.
- Megastructure is at the end of time. It contains civilization either being long gone - used in its construction, and itself - the civilization of builder - is in a state of crisis or past their prime with seemingly drawn out end in the form of Iron Law and Swarm's eventual ascent from the deeper Clockworks.
- Corporation is being contracted by builders of megastructure. Application of shadow damage also falls to this, as a most mysterious of technologies.
- Theme of Hell as corporation is expanded, as a front for a [cosmic horror conspiracy](). The corporation is a front for eldritch god's actions, Apocrea, as the latter is confronts the rest of existence.
- [Tone shift](). Aforemnetioned [tone shift]() should be noted as a characteristic trope. On a smaller scale, such as items, there are Witer grave, Biohazard, and Bitter End.
- Alchemy allows to pull items from different epochs from Cradle's past through acquisition of recipes and association of thematically embodying materials into an object. In order for alchemy to work, alchemy orbs work as the catalyst for transmutation. Given this, we can identify a broad combination of: ...
- Clockworks' facilities are powered by 5-star supernatural essences - a prime axample of [Magitech](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitech) and deeper exploration of elemental damage as magic.

#### Megastructure and Builders

Lastly, there are gremlins as the species of builders themselves. Here we separate builders' cicilization and the megastructure from the rest of the tropes, mainly due to them requiring a greater discussion to properly disect and select their key principles and components.

#### Katabasis: The Archetypical Descend Narrative

We have identidied tropes, respective larger motifs, overarching narratives, and how they allow the identity of the setting to be built up, even overlaying this progression and pacing over archetypical nature of Hero's Journey.

But, so far, it seems to us, that a metaphorical glue was still absent. There was a planet, a constucted world, and a megastructure, which had contained all of the above, but the relation to outsiders - Isorans, as proxies or protagonists for the narrative, a matter of their perception of the megastructure, - was left unexplored.

The essential and gateway element to this narrative of exploration with a specific pacing, through Isorans, driven by a need in energy and left stranded on Cradle, was left ambigious, but it is required for the entire system to work as it is, and we feel as if hints of it were all found. The prirary hint, or a notion, was identified ealrier - of a change in tone as the proximity to the Core inscreased, mapped onto a sliding scale of idealism to cynism, which was reflected in the scenery and plot of corresponding rank missions.

We propose, this glue, or an essential element of this system is the nature of a continious descend to the Core, perpetuated by an idea of an end, here being an aquisition of an energy source as the Core. In other words, it is the _descend narrative_, or, a classic term for it - __Katabasis__.

  Odyssey 11 allows us to sketch a basic outline of the requirements for this unique experience: the hero descends with divine assistance to the Underworld where he performs an important task, has significant encounters with ghosts, and comes back alive to proceed successfully with the rest of his endeavours.

  {/snippet}
</BookCitation>

The descend into the Underworld, within an established cosmology, evidently, does not focus on the location of Underworld, but a more metaphorical one, confrontation with a shadow and self, aspects, which fit particularly well to the Swarm.

But, we are working in a postmodern narrative, hence, we must consider existence of eldritch motifs and existence of Underworld proper. Those are absent, and Swarm manifests itself, as the metaphorical Underworld by acknowledging existence of the rest of reality, reflecting it in 2 particulars: shadow versions of monsters and presence within broken or damaged environment of Clockworks - 2 aspects, which exists as opposites to so far observed states, correposning to naturally existing mosnters, and continious operation of Clockworks under 'normal' conditions of what is considered 'natural'.

Shadow Lairs being a dark/unnatural/artificial reflection of reality seem to further accent its alienating properties. In particular, as an eldritch entity.

  4.3. Inaccessibility (with exceptions) to the living
  Since the realm of the dead is characterized by its separation and es-
  trangement from the realm of the living, the access of the living to such
  space is always something beyond exceptional. It cannot be absolutely inac-
  cessible since, by definition, if it were inaccessible the katab√°seis could not
  exist. However, this space is usually protected by great obstacles. Among
  these obstacles we often find a door, a great current of water and a boatman,
  vast spaces of barren and burning lands; sometimes everything at the same
  time. In the Mesopotamic tales of the ‚ÄúGreat Door‚Äù, a very large door to
  Hell is mentioned, located in the far West part of the region. The door can
  be reached after crossing a series of barren lands, a river that must be
  crossed with the help of the infernal boatman, and the border of the land-of-
  no-return 15. In Ur-Nammu in the Netherworld 73-75 it appears as a pitiful
  path, made by cart.
  Nevertheless, it is not only about obstacles. The kat√°basis implies a dis-
  ruption of the laws of space and time 16 because the traveller goes to the
  land of the dead whilst he is still alive even though that space should only
  be reached after death, and because this space is completely different from
  the one inhabited by the living. In this sense, it implies a transgression
  because it contradicts the order of the world. Thus only very special
  circumstances allow the transgression of a living being entering the realm of
  the dead; very special circumstances that have to do with the identity of the
  traveller and the existence of a divine mediator.

  {/snippet}
</BookCitation>

This aspect is refelected in the current procedure of reaching and surviving Shadow Lairs - aaprt frrom the requirement of the key, the transition presumes complete mastery of skill within the rest of reality, even compared to earlier largest obstacle of Firestoem Citadel. While this is an area of gamedesign, it nontheless imprinst some symbolic principles, discussed here.

So, the Swarm and Shadow Lairs become the Underworld, which, by the fact of being separate from the location of Underworld, mark themselves as separate concepts with individual themes. More evidense come up for the general narrative as Katabasis, is the fact Isorans are regarded as alien to Cradle, and are supposedly guided by a divine entity, as suggested by multiple instances of fated arrival and echo stones themselves. Then, before any narrative of staying takes form, it is established, that Spiral Order plans to leave Cradle after aquisition of the energy within the Core - the process of returning alive from the metaphorical Underworld, - Anabasis.

  4.4. Extraordinary travellers and divine assistants
  If the journey is extraordinary, it is presupposed that the traveller also
  needs to be extraordinary. The journey is therefore a test that will prove the
  exceptional status of the traveller, and what is to be obtained is also out of
  the ordinary. This is true in the case of gods as well as in the case of men.
  The divinity has greater capabilities to travel to the Netherworld, although
  he or she does not always have full freedom to take on this journey.

  But this status is not usually
  enough, since the protagonist normally requires divine assistance. When di-
  vine assistance that may legitimize the transgression is not provided, it is
  very difficult to attain one of the determinant factors of the kat√°basis: to re-
  turn from the realm of the dead.
  In this sense, it is usually relevant to the success or failure of the jour-
  ney whether the kat√°basis arises from a decision of the traveller or if it is
  due to a request, since this usually has a relation with legitimating the trip.

  ---

  5.2. Motivations of the traveller
  In the provisional definition of kat√°basis I have insisted that the travel-
  ler has a purpose. Since the kat√°basis is the Great Journey, these purposes
  are of great importance: it may grant possession of special goods, access to
  superior knowledge, etc. The most common intention of the traveller is to
  bring something from the Underworld. The repertoire of things to obtain is
  very wide.

  ---

  8.2. The extraordinary or dangerous journey
  A genre that is particularly related to the kat√°basis is the extraordinary
  journey, often to the margins of the world. The tablet IX of the Gilgamesh
  has many components of a kat√°basis: the hero starts a journey in search of
  the extraordinary gift of immortality. He must cross nearly impassable
  obstacles like the door of the Masu Mountain guarded by scorpion men. He
  has people who assist him in his journey, like Siduri who takes him before
  the boatman Ursanabi. The boatman then navigates the waters of death car-
  rying the hero to the presence of Utnapishtim. The journey ends with a
  partial failure: Gilgamesh obtains the plant of eternal youth but it is taken
  away from him by a snake while the hero is bathing in a fountain. It is
  paradigmatic in so far as it marks the borders between god and men,
  between mortals and immortals that the hero can transgress in a certain way,
  but his failure is an indication that the state of things cannot be modified.
  These are all the elements of a kat√°basis except for the main one:
  Gilgamesh does not descend to the Netherworld nor the realm of the deads.
  Instead he travels to remote spaces, to the margins of the world.

  These are all the elements of a kat√°basis except for the main one:

The descend itself is the contents of Katabasis - the events between the descend and ascent. The act of continious descend presents an opportunity and a setting for the stories to exist and unfold, while the major narrative - of reaching Core, is left in the background, only taking precedence in the final acts of the story, as the events accompanying the main quast create the desired themes.

The Swarm, under this interpretation, is an embodyment of an archetypical shadow of Hero's Journey, one that requires action and confrontation from the protagonist.

The fact that this is also an eldritch entity mirroring Isorans in their need in energy and the Core, but also a culmination of, under Rebis Theory, of multitude of attempts of Underwold to seige Cradle, positions Isorans as an important figure within the in-universe narrative - as we have proposed them being the next guardian civilization, which, throughout history, were a few.

Thoughout this descend milestones or story arcs are reached, - such as a few starting missions up to Gloaming Wildwoods, infinltration of Royal Jelly Palace, followed by plans of Roarmulus Twins, then reaching a large portion of missions regarding underlying gremlin plot (Spark and Roar) in the background, with a primary focus on the Firestorm Citadel, as the last milestone before the Core.

And those milestones can be mapped onto the Hero's Journey as they are, essentially, components of a written story, within which archetypes can be seen through, regardless of their concrete representation in a concrete setting, as long as a corresponding narrative can be recognized.

Although in the rank missions there is no direct corelation between civilization's age and their depth, it seems to be well implied - given general transition from weird mundane, up to alienation and hostility of Almire, as an embodied of hell, Hades, and, supposedly, most dangerous location on Cradle so far.

And it would've been an end to the descend as a well tied story of reaching the Core. But intead, the Core ends up being sealed and the ongoing narrative, set in a background, - of following Alpha Squad, - takes precedence. The story becomes an exploration of Clockworks in search of methods of openning the Core. The descend narrative reaches its plateau.

Before we transition to the next step of the narrative, we must look at the curent endgame, suggested by the Arcade and rank missions. Difficulty-wise, Dream and Nightmare, while are to be covered later in the analysis, and are deeper into the Clockworks by the fact of being inside the Core, exist after the proposed intermission. Instead, we suggest, that Shadow Lairs represent currently the darkest and deeper point of Clockworks, metaphorically. We acknowledge that in our theory we have proposed, that true scale and source of the Swarm is to be found deeper inside the Core, and there are artifacts suggesting a greater confrontation in the future, but, as we have abstained for this chapter of those lore specificities, Shadow Lairs are so far the most fitting candidate for the darkest and deepest location.

If we are to introcuce, even without artfacts, presence of Sanctuary - as a point of respite, - Shadow Lairs within the Hero's Journey, we believe, represent the challenges preceding the death and rebirth at the lowest point of the Journey, which fits with the aforementioned confrontation in the future. If Shadow Lairs are the endgame, as they are currently, experience of those is the process of death and rebirth, being the deepest point of the Journey, and one by great margin most difficult.

  The purpose of the journey may be more abstract; very often the
  traveller seeks to gain knowledge or information of the Underworld, or de-
  termined details that a specific deceased may know, considering that the
  dead may have special knowledge that is banned to men. Since the dead are
  out of the realm of time, those who have not lost their capabilities may be
  able to unite present, past, and future.

If if take later Refuge in account, Alpha Squad does possess an intrumental knowledge on the Swarm and Sleeper, introducing deific property to late-game narrative. In their regard, they are framed as lost, which seem us to fit the postion of the dead as entities in adifferent state of being. Coupled with the knowledge of those forces, as eldritch, we may also consider a fundamentally differnt level of understanding of the setting by those actors:

  4.1. Transit of the dead and travel of the living
  The kat√°basis assumes that human beings continue having a form of ex-
  istence after death, even if it is precarious or wretched. As M. Ganschinietz
  pointed out, this should not be understood as the life of the soul after its sep-
  aration from the body 11. Instead, for this mentality there exists a unit that is
  ‚Äúman‚Äù that ceases to exist with the dissolution of the body, and that upon
  death passes to a new state.

  ---

  8.4. Dialogues with the dead: euocationes, apparitions and dreams
  The conversation with the dead is common also between the kat√°basis
  and the euocationes, like the apparition of the ghost of Darius to his wife
  Atossa in Aeschylus‚Äô Persians. In other occasions the dead may appear to a
  living being without a ritual of evocation to tell him or her what goes on in
  the other world. In the case of Enkidu‚Äôs descent, which starts in a failed
  kat√°basis, his soul comes out from a slit to instruct Gilgamesh on what hap-
  pens in the Netherworld. The deceased can also be seen in dreams, like
  Patroclus who appears to Achilles in a dream.

  All these cases coincide with the kat√°basis in that there is a contact
  between the living and the dead, the deceased can provide special knowl-
  edge to the living, the apparition may dissuade from a bad ritual or moral
  behaviour, or it may serve as a pretext to present imagery from the Nether-
  world or advance information about the future. However, the evocations,
  apparitions, and dreams are different from a kat√°basis in that the living are
  passive, evoking, receiving, or dreaming, but they do not travel to the Un-
  derworld and they are not in danger.

In case of the latter, while a lesser example, but a fitting one - in Refuge, Perma is not met directly, but rather it is establiched that its scout offers the most probable presence.

Then, while the means and ends do remain relatively unknown for specifics of Cradle's existence as a megastructure, a second element is presented - a danger of the same scope and scale, which postions itself, as one of formidable power, and in opposition to Sleeper.

Located physically above the Core civilizations are rendered trivial in front of an existential threat rootef at the foundations of the settings - that is means of Cradle's existence, revolving around builders, megastructure itself, and its end.

This next step of this new narrative is embodies by a set of mission up to Shadowplay, as it presents a pradigm shift, an intermission between King of Ashes and Dream and Nightmare of the Core opening. Then, a possibility of descending further is presented, but now accelerated by the urgency of a direct threat. This, within a larger narrative, seemingly present a test of skills, gained throughout unlimited exlporation, now paired with a direct purpose, characterized by multiple plots coming together.

And, it is, consequently, eeduire - to give a satisfying end to a descend, given MMO medium. And it would not be likely reached, but, one thing that alows for this narrative to continue, is the change, which follows by the pardigm shift of the Core opening. This paradigm is a change of the scene - there is no bottom, as was with Cradle. The volume, as we have suggested to exist within the Core, is a transitory location into a different dimmension. This change allows to continiously hide the bottom of the descend by removing it as a concept in a larger scale of the setting.



<!-- a technology to build, or rather, mirror the rest of the Clockworks, powered by the Nameless Realm, its energy, emerged - the swarm. Originally, invention of gremlins, with the energy from the Nameless Realm, it is transformed into an semi-organic entity (in similar manner as spiral battle sprites will be transformed into biomechanical entities). Now It is an entity of very same energy of Nameless Realm, both a technology and a constant - a shape of the sentient energy same as the Sleeper, once it is brought into the material realm.

A Core is built and the rest of the clockworks were built by the swarm of machines, capable of replicating matter from energy. For the Nameless Realm separated fto the material realm gremlins had there own name - the Whitespace. Within the strange matter of whitespace, Sleeper now rests protected in the Core, separate from the unity and divinity of Nameless Realm proper, referred to as the Void, not malevolent one currently, but a form of most primordial of matter.

As Clockworks were built, some of the most dangerous entities of the Cradle were made hidden within the deepest parts of Clockworks, such as fallen Almirian capital - the Necropolis, Great Citadel, know only known as the Firestorm Citadel, and once floating through Cradle's sky Owlite Scarlet Fortress, traveling through Clockworks as a mass of castles.

https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crossing_the_Chasm

If Clockworks were being constructed during that time, they must have to originate from the Core, in order to be built, which ties in with the relation of an Architect and the Sleeper within the Shadow Lairs' Sanctuary, it also will be revisited later, but currently these possible implications must be kept in mind. This also leads to a possibility of gremlins originally being rather underground specie, as the Core either have been built in-place of Cradle's natural core, or was lowered theres.

The process of Core construction implies at least presence of the Core hatch, access consoles and the Artifact, with the consoles being present in a few locations on Cradle, including the Firestorm Citadel and Royal Jelly Palace. Now, considering that [the Gauntlet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Gauntlet) is guarded by gremlins in the [Reign of Fire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Gauntlet) as well as the [Last Stand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Gauntlet/Last_Stand) has elements of Scarlet Fortress and Clockworks' monitors, it is plausible for gremlins to fortify this passage to the Citadel intentionally, for reasons explored in the next section.

Backing to the Core, the Whitespace within has same element of clockwork tunnels being replaced by Whitespace tiles, as well as an entire skydome structure present within the Core ([Refuge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Refuge), [Sanctuary](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sanctuary), if believed to be located within the Core), that must also be kept in mind for the overarching themes.

nameless realm of dreaming entities - which create, origin of souls as raw energy, and its opposite - apocrean realm whose inhabitants make nightmares, still create and are powered by souls, there souls die. The abyss just is?

The Void is weaponized by the presence of curse originating from the Underworld. This prime matter itself has no will no intent and flows from Nameless Realm into the material, both as the source of all matter but also as souls for living beings. Those 2 forms of primal matter are all at their core energy. This energy, mainly in form of souls, after death in material realm, reaches Underworld, and from there - into the Blinding Abyss. Apocrea here is the middleman who lives on that same energy, yet it can't reach Nameless Realm. Then it acts through underworld, whose death-based nature manifests as curse, which though actions of gremlins, had affected pure energy of Nameless Realm. This caused gremlins to seal Swarm with the portion of Nameless Realm within the Core, wherein core served as an extractor of energy from nameless realm.

Here we would return for the alchemy orbs and alchemy stations. With the knowledge of both energy in the setting, and of the vague nature of real-world alchemy, it being manifestations of energy in the same manner as fire crystals and minerals, but of higher order composition, for example, souls, as in charged minerals. We know that as they preserve the memory of the time they existed, yet they had to be indistinguishable, in order to perform stable alchemy. This lead to an idea, which would allow for the process of transmutation to work as intended, while remaining in the confinements of alchemy, - that is the hegelian World Spirit, an omnipresent unconscious memory of the world within a certain culture.

We arrive to this conclusion mainly due to optionality of recipes for Sanctuary and Mysterious alchemy station, as this would mean that the knight already, paradoxically, is aware of, for example, Almirian or Kat Tribe designs. The only way those could exist, as if the knowledge of those was given. And, within the metaphysics of the Core, which tethers everything, such understanding would be plausible, as it is accumulated in a more reaving presence of an entity, knowing of what was happening throughout history.

The container of 2 golden plates, we suggest, is the same phenomenon as used on Cradle, to contain the divinity - of a part of Nameless Realm, - in the most pure metal. If we to follow alchemical symbolism of gold, it is the divine metal which is linked to the divinity, here symbolized by the cosmology of Nameless Realm.

`The work is crowned by the production of the rotundum, which, as the materia globosa, stands at the beginning and also at the end, in the form of gold.`

This makes it seem as if Orb of Alchemy already was the completed Work, and yet it is a tool in the general narrative.

In regards to the Fire Crystal, they have similar inner glow as orbs of alchemy. Apart from those similarities, heat is present as an floating essence, or as fire crystals. As with the energy and souls, we suggest, heat is the same in nature, that is it can be collected to crystals, under the same principle as minerals contain energy.
