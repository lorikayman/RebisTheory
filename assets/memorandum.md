## MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Vanguards, Cpt. Ozlo

**FROM:** Haven Lab & Core On-site Team

**SUBJECT:** Cradle and Theory of Everything

**Hail Knights! This has been a long time coming.**

Our researchers have compiled the **most complete to date timeline**, â€” a proposal, where history of Cradle, its every depth, every material and recipe, every gear and _everything_ in between was dissected, analyzed, put together, and **solved**, so that going forward no unanswered questions would remain.

This proposal for the timeline is available under the codename of

[**The REBIS THEORY ðŸœ”**](https://lorikayman.github.io/entries/rebis-theory)

Here we are to identify:

- Cosmology and its nuances;
- History of Tortodrones and their creators;
- Prime actors, factions, and their goals;
- Owlites and Valkyries, greater Heavenly Kingdom, and the Kat Tribe;
- History of 3 warring kingdoms;
- Undercorp, Underworld, and its deities;
- Nature of curse;
- Clockworks, the Core, and the Architect;

We believe we have identified their respective themes, alchemical and eldritch motifs, and **much more**. Most importantly, we present a **cohesive, complete system, to which entirety of Cradle's cosmology and metaphysics abides**.

Considering the scope of the document, be rest assured, â€” our biotechs are ~~outsourcing to Undercorp~~ already working on the video presentation.
