## Narrative, thematic, and worldbuilding over-analysis of Spiral Knights. Rebis Theory.

Our researchers have published a proposal, where history of Cradle, its every depth and region, every material and recipe, every piece of equipment and weapon was researched, analyzed, and cross-referenced in order to offer a narratively satisfying, cohesive and conclusive interpretation of Spiral Knights' timeline.

We propose an explanation for, to name a few:

- Metaphysics of Cradle and greater Cosmology;
- Prime actors, factions, their goals:
  - History of Tortodrones and their creators;
  - Owlites and Valkyries, Heavenly Kingdom;
  - Ancient dragons;
  - History of kingdoms on Cradle;
  - Tojans' past;
  - Role of gunslinger priests;
- Underworld and its deities;
- Precise involvement of Undercorp and greater Underworld throughout history;
- Nature of curse, energy, of auras and souls;
- Gremlins, Clockworks, and the Core, history of Cradle.
- Nature and origin of the Swarm.

This proposal is available under the codename of Rebis Theory:

Given scale of the document, our reserachers are already working on a video presentation.
