## Narrative, thematic analysis of Spiral Knights' worldbuilding and lore: Rebis Theory

Our researchers have published a proposal, where history of Cradle, its every depth and region, every material and recipe, every piece of dialogue and lore was researched, analyzed, and cross-referenced into a single unified system.

We propose an explanation for, to name a few:

- Metaphysics of Cradle and greater Cosmology;
- Prime actors, factions, their goals:
  - History of Tortodrones and their creators;
  - Owlites and Valkyries, Heavenly Kingdom;
  - Ancient dragons;
  - History of kingdoms on Cradle;
  - Tojans;
  - Role of gunslinger priests;
- Underworld and its deities;
- Precise involvement of Undercorp and greater Underworld throughout history;
- Nature of curse, energy, of auras and souls;
- Gremlins, Clockworks, and the Core, history of Cradle.
- Nature and origin of the Swarm.

This proposal is available under the codename of Rebis Theory:

Rebis Theory is meant to overanalyze Spiral Knightsâ€™ themes, worldbuilding, and lore with a primary goal of offering a narratively satisfying, cohesive and conclusive interpretation of the timeline.

Despite its scale, we do hope it can provide as much satisfaction and sense of closure of the presented mysteries for the reader, as it did for us.
