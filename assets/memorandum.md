## Alchemy and Everything. Narrative, thematic, timeline analysis of Spiral Knights. Rebis Theory.

Our researchers have compiled a proposal, where history of Cradle, its every depth and lost civilization, every material and recipe, and _everything_ it offers was dissected, analyzed, and put together into a single timeline and an emerging, overarching system.

We believe, we have identified, to name a few:

- Metaphysics and Cosmology of Cradle;
- Prime actors, factions, and their goals;
- History of Tortodrones and their creators;
- Owlites and Valkyries, Heavenly Kingdom;
- History of 3 warring kingdoms;
- Underworld, its deities;
- Precise involvement of Undercorp and greater Underworld throughout history;
- Nature of cursem energy, of auras and souls;
- Clockworks, the Core, gremlins and the Architect.

This proposal is available under the codename of [**REBIS THEORY ðŸœ”**](https://lorikayman.github.io/entries/rebis-theory).

And, given scale of presented theory, our reserachers are already working on the video presentation.
