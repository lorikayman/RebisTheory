## Timeline and Everything. Narrative, thematic, and lore over-analysis of Spiral Knights. The Rebis Theory.

Our researchers have published a proposal, where history of Cradle, its every depth and region, every material and recipe, every piece of Isoran equipment and weapon was reserahced, cross-referenced, analyzed, and put together into a single timeline and an emerging, overarching system.

We believe, we have identified, to name a few:

- Metaphysics and Cosmology of Cradle;
- Prime actors, factions, their goals;
- History of Tortodrones and their creators;
- Owlites and Valkyries, Heavenly Kingdom;
- Ancient dragons;
- History of kingdoms on Cradle;
- Underworld and its deities;
- Precise involvement of Undercorp and greater Underworld throughout history;
- Nature of curse, energy, of auras and souls;
- Gremlins, Clockworks, and the Core.
- And of course, the Swarm, it nature and origin.

This proposal is available under the codename of [**REBIS THEORY**](https://lorikayman.github.io/entries/rebis-theory). Spoiler warning about everything.

Given scale of the document, our reserachers are working on the video presentation, which aims to provide both greater visuals and an expandad analysis of the narrative.
