### I. Separation

#### I.1. Call to Adventure

Happens when a hero is ready for transformation, willingly or not. The change may be violent, and accompanied by introduction of a herald of crisis, representative of unknown world. The herald may be a tuned down variation of true beasts from the unknown world, which may lead to hero misinterpreting the road ahead.

The herald may posses sa beastial or repulsive nature, concealing symbolism of the unknown juxtapised to the known world.

> Gremlins, Razwog, to isorans
> Iron Sentinel, a lumber construct, to morai machines

The location ,from which herald comes is also completely alien to an inhabitant of the knnown world.

> Cradle as a phenomenal megastructure

#### I.2. Refusal of the Call

Refusal inverts advanture into its opposite - a mundanity devoid of grows, or even promising turmoil. Any action in this state is accompanied by a tendency to decay, unless great effort is made to coompensate for this inclination. This push only lengthens the eventual death of the endevaour starting from the initial call as it marks the momnt of change.

<!--Whatever house he builds, it will be a house of death-->

#### I.3. Supernatural Aid

If a hero did not refuse the [call to adventure](#i1-call-to-adventure), they will meet a figure familiar with the unknown, which initially guides the hero, gives an advace or grant a degree of protection or assistance.

Through causality of the world, if the hero had answered to the call, the aid in some form presents itself. It may not be a figure which hero may encounter directly, or even recognize it as such, but it is an essential element for progression of hero's spiritual transformation.

It is also here a presence of cosmic guiding power is established, which at a current point in time is embodied by the helping figure. It may be a distinct entity from the helping figure, but the latetr is aware of the prior, as they are familiar with this hidden world.

#### I.4. The Crossing of the First Threshold

The threshold may be seen as a boundary of a sphere of known by the hore, beyond which is the greater unknown. The threshold guardign encoubtered by the hero is encoutered atthat boundary. The boundary may map onto physical world as one located in 4 cardinal directions or above or below the earth.

In fact, this guardian role is only present from the narrative of a hero as the fisrst instance for them of the inhabitants of the unknown. They are more distant from traditions of the hero, alien to him. As much as those entities exist, they become threshold guardians in presence of the hero and the accompanied myth as framing device.

Those entities possess knowledge of the unknwon which, compared to the supernatural aid, not willing to share unless a deal is made, which may require competence and courage - they bestow knowledge or magic power.

Yet, this entity of unknown within the narrtive of a hero is being overcome by the hero while the other travellers are defeated by it. This act is achieved by the hero specifcally due to him leaving their old principles which had guided them in the known, leaving his ego, and though this, crossing the threshold into the unknown.

#### I.5. The Belly of the Whale
