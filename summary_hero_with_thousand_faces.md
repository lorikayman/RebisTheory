## Structure Analysis

### I. Separation

#### I.1. call to Adventure

Happens when a hero is ready for transformation, willingly or not. The change may be violent, and accompanied by introduction of a herald of crisis, representative of unknown world. The herald may be a tuned down variation of true beasts from the unknown world, which may lead to hero misinterpreting the road ahead.

The herald may posses sa beastial or repulsive nature, concealing symbolism of the unknown juxtapised to the known world.

> Gremlins, Razwog, to isorans
> Iron Sentinel, a lumber construct, to morai machines

The location ,from which herald comes is also completely alien to an inhabitant of the knnown world.

> Cradle as a phenomenal megastructure

#### I.2. Refusal of the Call

Refusal inverts advanture into its opposite - a mundanity devoid of grows, or even promising turmoil. Any action in this state is accompanied by a tendency to decay, unless great effort is made to coompensate for this inclination. This push only lengthens the eventual death of the endevaour starting from the initial call as it marks the momnt of change.

<!--Whatever house he builds, it will be a house of death-->

#### I.3. Supernatural Aid

If a hero did not refuse the [call to adventure](#i1-call-to-adventure), they will meet a figure familiar with the unknown, which initially guides the hero, gives an advace or grant a degree of protection or assistance.
