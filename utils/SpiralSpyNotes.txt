Happyapathy's Guide to Using Spiral Spy V1.0 (a.k.a. A Lesson in the Benefits of Paranoia)

Guide Version 1.0
-------------------------------------

Spiral Spy can be downloaded from "http://www.onyxbits.de/spiralspy"

-------------------------------------
An Important to all Would-Be Scene makers:

Credits for making Spiral Spy goes to Spiral-Spy, I am but a humble paranoid user who has crashed his
program many, many times, as I explore it.

This is a great program but keep in mind it IS a V 1.0 program and is VERY VERY temperamental, do not push your luck while working on something serious, only while experimenting.

-------------------------------------

SAFETY FIRST:


1. Copy ALL Spiral Knights files into a new seperate folder
2. Place Spiral Spy into this folder, NOT the folder that game is read from

	Certain actions in Spiral Spy may muck up actual game, by doing this
	you avoid touching the real game. If you already went ahead without 
	reading this and accidentaly broke the real game best solution is to
	uninstall and reinstall Spiral Knights, your character will be safe
	so its fine.

-------------------------------------

WARNINGS TO THE EXTREME:

- Closing Spiral Spy may result in loss of certain changes, it will DEFINATELY result in your player model been reset and losing any information attached to it

- Closing Spiral Spy will also clip Snipe's wings from them :(

- Play around A LOT BEFORE YOU GET SERIOUS

	A single bad click can crash the program and destroy your work, figure out what
	makes the program explode and be ready to CTRL+ALT+DEL a number of times.

- If your really paranoid about losing stuff, write down the information about it (FX's used, coordinate points, degree rotations, etc) somewhere so you can quickly remake it if something bad happens.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now for a tragic, tragic note:

To make a new scene you MUST delete everything from the previous one unless you plan to reuse parts, making a scene is like making a sand castle, it will eventually be destroyed, so take LOTS AND LOTS of screenshots when your done cause you will NEVER get a chance to come back to it once you start a new one. Spiral Spy is working on a means
of saving but until then

How to do certain things:

---------

==== Enabling more animations ====

1. Under Model click Config
2. Find file rsrc/character/pc/model_level.dat
3. Select and press open

	The animation list at the bottom should now be expanded to include a few more
	animations, though many are still missing, read on to find out how to get them

---------

==== Select specific unlisted animations ====

1. Set model to model_level.dat (see above)
2. Under model click "Edit"
3. Search for the "New Animation Mapping" Button (its a bit hard to find) and click it
4. Give new animation a name
5. Under Animation click the "(none)" button
6. Go to directory rsrc/character/pc/(animation folder if necessary)
7. search for desired Animation
8. certain particle/FX's can be added to animations, as well as certain actions

WARNING:
- Closing the animation window will WIPE OUT your chosen animation and any FX's and actions you may have added, DO NOT CLOSE IT (may also be a good idea to write down the properties you gave it just in case)

---- Tutorial 1.1: Making your knight sit ----

1. Follow steps 1 - 3 from the above
2. Under name type "custom_sit"
3. Under Animation click the "(none)" button
4. Go to directory rsrc/character/pc/emotes

	Note that if you keep scrolling you will find that many of the animations are not
	actually in folders, keep that in mind when looking for other animations

5. Select "animation_sit-loop.dat" and press Open

	The other two "sit" animations are only for the part when your knight first sits and when they
	stand back up, try them to see what I mean.

6. Go back to the main window, DO NOT CLOSE the animation window
7. Scroll to the bottom of the Animations list, you should now see "custom_sit"
8. select your animation, press Start, and sit back and enjoy your sitting knight

---- Tutorial 1.2: How to make your sitting knight EXPLODE!! ----

1. Follow the previous tutorial
2. Go to the Animation window you opened earlier

	DO NOT click EDIT from the main model panel again cause it will open
	a new window WITHOUT your sit animation

3. Under your "custom_sit" animation click EDIT
4. In the new window that appears click the "New Frame Action" button

	Note that certain animations already come with a set of Actions already attached to them

5. Change the "Frame" number to 20.00

	This will delay the Action a bit before it happens

6. Change the "Type" to "Spawn Transient"
7. Click the "(none)" button that should appear
8. Go to directory rsrc/particle/explosion
9. Select and open the first FX listed there "bomb_areaexplosion.dat"

	You have to leave this window open also, cause if you close it you will lose the
	Action information you made for your animation

10. Go back to the main screen and play custom_sit animation, something should happen after a few moments...
